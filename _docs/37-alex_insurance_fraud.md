Alex tried to commit what looks like Insurance Fraud to an insurance policy that was in my name. In one phone call, **She** added jewellery cover to the home and contents insurance of the matrimonial home while at the same time lowering the excess amount to $1000. Then a few months later she made a claim for jewellery that she reckons that she lost a local pool which would have had to be worth more than the excess, more than $1000 worth of jewellery.

You called up Youi on December 16, to add jewellery cover to the limit of $7,500 , a change to my MY home and contents insurance which I paid for ($1,345.38 on Nov 11, 2019) after we separated. At the same time December 16, you also lowered the excess from $1,225 to $1,000, you also authorised the additional cover payment $64.83 which was taken off my credit card (after we had been separated) and while you were receiving child support payments from me. Then you call up just this week with a story you lost jewellery at the pool, but this would have had to be worth more than the excess of $1000 in order to make this worthwhile to you. This is a bit of a coincidence - Insurance fraud I’m thinking? What’s going on Alex, and who would take over $1000 worth of jewellery to a pool with kids?

Alex calls up just this week with a story that she lost jewellery at the pool or it was stolen, but this would have had to be worth more than the excess of $1000 in order to make this worthwhile to her. Plus one of the items of jewellery lost was an engagement ring (just after Alex and Marc's separation). This is all a bit of a coincidence - it looks like Insurance fraud
