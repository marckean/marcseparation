## Last weekend of school holidays

> Tuesday, December 28, 2021

Alex and I had an agreement that I have the kids, 27, 28, 29 January 2022 (last weekend of school holidays).

Alex's email to me, dated December 28, 2021 says that her BFF **Bec** is looking after the kids on Monday Jan 31:

> Thursday, December 30, 2021

However, this contradicts Alex's other email she sent to me dated December 30, 2021 (two days later) where she said school goes back on the Friday January 28, 2022. 

So, back then when the emails were sent, in Alex's head, if she believed that school went back on the Friday January 28, 2022, then **Bec** canâ€™t have possibly had plans to look after the kids on the Monday, as the kids would have been in school.

Now we know that school goes back on Tuesday February 1st, 2022. 

## School holidays ending

An official letter from the school principal (dated: Tuesday, 25th January 2022) says for both Charlie & Chloe, they are to return to school in 2020 on Tuesday, February 1 2022.
