## Statements from the report

The current living conditions for the home are totally the opposite to that of the report. 

- Just like Alex’s mother, there’s crap left all over the place
- The house is filthy and disgusting 

These videos are real walk through videos of the state of the home since separation. It's a dump, the the living conditions are far from optimal in anyone's standards.

This video below, you will notice that about half way through that there's a completely loose cable on the back balcony which is totally dangerous, as kids can fall straight through about 5+ meters to the ground.
