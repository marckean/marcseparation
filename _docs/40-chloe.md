## CAST (Childhood Autism Spectrum Test)

I sat with Chloe and we did a [CAST](https://psychology-tools.com/test/cast) together. Formerly the “**Childhood Asperger’s Syndrome Test**”, this is a 39-item, yes or no evaluation aimed at parents. The questionnaire was developed by ARC (the Autism Research Centre) at the University of Cambridge, for assessing the severity of autism spectrum symptoms in children. [As we know](/marcseparation/my_initial_comments/#no-official-aspergers-diagnosis), there is no blood test or medical imaging scan to diagnose the Asperger’s syndrome condition, so questionnaires are the more common way measuring it.

I know my daughter fairly well, and like I assumed, it looks like she's like me and has Asperger's syndrome.
