## Statements from the report

![](../blobs/childsupport/report_alex_children_financial_gain.jpg)

- I say in the report that Alex is using the Children for financial gain

![](../blobs/childsupport/report_alex_child_support.jpg)

- Then Alex practically spells it out, she's not willing to allow me more time with the kids as then she gets less money from child support and screws up her plans for a mortgage


## My rebuttal

Ever since separation, Alex hasn't managed to get a full-time job and move on with her life. Even though we have separated, she is still heavily dependant on me for finances.
