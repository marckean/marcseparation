## Charlie & Covid19

On Monday August 8, 2022, Charlie was diagnosed with Covid19.

I emailed the school to let them know:

The school replied:

Knowing Alex like I know Alex, especially when very recently when [Chloe had a Covid19 test and had to isolate, this led to Alex calling the Police](/marcseparation/chloe_covid_test/). I knew this would lead to something totally crazy. So I quickly did my homework and called **NSW Health** to find out the latest rules and regulations for a positive case.

When I asked **NSW Health** the two questions, about the latest rules for a young 11y/0 in a shared card arrangement and who is a positive case for Covid19 and also the penalties for breaching a public health order, they pointed me int he direction of the information on their website:

I took screenshots and then let Alex know about Charlie with Covid19, his test results, he was being well looked after and the latest rules of self isolation. Something so simple, but it wasn't. 

I anticipated that Alex wouldn't go down without a fight, so I also called my lawyer to give him the heads up that I didn't want to pay for his time with this trivial matter, and if he gets a call from Alex's lawyer, to just ignore it and don't act on my behalf. 

What happened next was a constant stream of abuse from Alex...
