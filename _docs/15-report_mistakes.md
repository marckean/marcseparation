There are many errors in this report. Like I was saying [here](/marcseparation/#the-family-report---why-were-here), someone's interpretation using a pen/paper to note things down is prone for for errors, humans are not perfect, they make mistakes. 

You need to seriously question the credibility of this report writer. 

As the audio of the sessions wasn't recorded either digitally or analog, there's no way to prove the accuracy of anything in the report and based on the [contradictions](/marcseparation/report_contradictions/) and the mistakes which I have listed here, this entire report is questionable.

## Simple mistakes

![report_contradictions_sat_4](../blobs/reportcontradictions/report_contradictions_sat_4.png)

- This is one is totally incorrect as **Rebecca** has no family relation at all with Andrew Kyngdon.

![report_accuracy_1](../blobs/accuracy/report_accuracy_1.png)

- At the time of the report, I am only 45 years of old and I don't live in Chatswood, I live in Asquith. 

## Other mistakes

### Holiday time with the kids

![](../blobs/missedmentions/report_time_holidays_alex.png)

- This is false, inaccurate, I have been consistent all the time and always wanted week on / week off (50/50) with the kids, this includes the holidays.

### Stick next to bed

![](../blobs/missedmentions/report_stick_next_bed.png)

- This stick was like a long wooden dowel (cylindrical rod) and was beside the bed for self defence only. As [I have already documented here](/marcseparation/alex_mental_health/#the-house-is-constantly-left-unlocked), Alex constantly leaves the house unlocked, and still does today. Times when I went to bed first before Alex, there was no guarantee the house would be locked before she went to bed and I needed to be ready to defend myself and my family in case of an intruder in the home. Same thing in my car, I have a long metal cylindrical pole in my car beside the car seat ready in case of road rage to defend myself. Always be prepared. My father used to do the same, always be ready just in case.
