### Thu, 4 Nov 2021

At about 8.20pm I was on the phone with the kids and saying good night. I said to Chloe (my daughter):

I said *You know I love you very much don’t you?* Chloe said *Yes* 
	 
I said *you know that I’m here for you, if you need to contact me, you call me anytime, you know that don’t you?* Chloe said *Yes*
	 
I said *you know that I’d do anything for you don’t you? Anything at all, I’d even jump off a cliff* (said in tongue & cheek) Chloe said *Yes, but I wouldn’t ask you to do that* Chloe’s voice was warm and not concerned in anyway, as she knew I was being my normal silly Daddy self. 
 
Mummy (Alex) was in the background and could hear the call

The Police came to visit me in person. They told me about the conversation and about the comment about "jumping off a cliff" and needed to do their due-diligence to make sure that I was OK, which they could easily see that I was OK. 

Cops left shortly after arriving, but then I thought about it. Alex is not concerned for my safety at all. Alex just wants anything and everyone on record, as much ammunition she can so she doesn’t lose access to the kids, make me look like an un-fit Dad. 
 
Alex denied all of this of course, however she goes to the Police herself to find out what happened, then Alex calls me. Apparently it was her sister Victoria Spence which called the Police and Alex was un-aware of this (what Alex says)

### Sat, 13 Nov 2021

In relation to this event that occurred last week (above) of me saying good night to Chloe. The kids were with me this weekend so they filled me in with more detail. 
 
The kids told me that after I hung up the phone on that night, Alex's sister Victoria, her comment was *He’s such a dickhead* Alex was there in the room with the kids, the kids heard this as well. 
 
Alex's sister calling me a dickhead in front of the kids - the kids told me they didn't like it at all and were totally uncomfortable and felt weird.
