### General living

The below is a video when I went to the house at one stage since separation and I mowed the lawn and did the edges. I did a comparison video on the before and after, you will see a massive difference.

I take pride on keeping places clean to a good standard. As it was my job to mostly keep the outside of the home clean e.g. the lawn, I extended this and even looked after my next door neighbours lawn while they were away. The following video will show you the before, mid-point and after view of the lawn after I did the edges and mowed the lawn for him (John).
