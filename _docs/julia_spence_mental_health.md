Julia Spence has always had issues with her mental health. Julia was known to have a problem handling Alcohol, and after only a couple of glasses of wines, she’d be out of control drunk.

Bec’s comment was “She’s a bad egg” - **Rebecca Illes** is Alex's best friend and spoke to Ruth Selig in the Family Report. 

Below are some of the things that Julia did when she came to visit in our home before Alex and I separated. 

- She slammed doors in the house while we were trying to sleep
- She traced mud through the house, on brand new carpet
- She broke a coffee machine due to mistreatment, after she forcibility used it
- She’d smoke cigarettes in the backyard around the children after being told not to
- She’d leave a stash of cigarette buts in accessibility range of the kids
- She had a bottle of wine in her car while my two kids were there in the car with her
