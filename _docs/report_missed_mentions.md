Whilst in the session with Dr Ruth Selig, there were several things that I mentioned that were missed in the report.

## Teaching the kids life skills

- I mentioned that one of the things I was most proud of was that I taught the kids table manners whilst I was still living in the house. My father who was a CEO at large companies throughout his life, **wined and dined** with his other business people and it was imperative that he spoke correctly and acted correctly as he was representing his company. People judge others by the way they speak and act which includes things like table manners. Even today, the kids tell me that now they are proud that even tell other peers (their friends) the correct table manners.
