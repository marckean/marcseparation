## Back balcony

As per the page on the living conditions of the house, [the house is not safe](/marcseparation/living_conditions/#the-house-is-totally-not-safe). This is the railing of the top balcony at the back of the house, kids can fall down through this, land on the ground and could seriously injure themselves of whats worse, kill themselves.

### The railing is still not fixed

On January 16, 2022, I was back at the house and noticed that not the railing is still not fixed and has gotten worse, it's the entire length of the railing, the wire has totally ome out.

## Alex is hands off parenting

As per [this section](/marcseparation/alex_parenting/#alex-is-never-around). Alex is following the same parenting style as her own mother. We can see how this turned out for Alex's sister Julia, she killed herself.

Julia had a real drinking problem and was a chain smoker amongst having bipolar disorder, not being able to hold down a job and as Bec said, she's a "*bad egg*". 

Leaving the home at 14, no father in her life (as he was dead at the time), the mother was behind the scenes as Julia lived in share accommodation with Alex and Alex's gay friend Kristan. Julia lacked the support and guidance needed to develop into a decent woman to have somewhat of a chance of a normal life.

This is a classic text book case that directly reflects the reports from what the experts say that kids turn out best with shared custody between both Mother and Father.

The highlights from the expert studies:

- children with a shared parenting arrangement have better physical, mental, social and academic outcomes compared to children in a primary parenting arrangement
- children with shared parenting had better outcomes for physical health, psychological well-being, moods and emotions, self-perception, autonomy, parental relations, material outcomes, peer relations, school satisfaction and social acceptance
- children in a shared parenting arrangement had better outcomes on all measured variables for well-being, most notably for their family relationships, physical health, adolescent behaviour and mental health
