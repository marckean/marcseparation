## My summary of the report

This family report does a great job in discrediting me as a father with Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's syndrome is very common and very highly successful people have Asperger's syndrome, e.g. Bill Gates & Elon Musk. Likewise, I shouldn't be penalised as a father just because I **may** have Asperger's syndrome. 

### Report's focus on previous life

Previous life being more than 2 years ago, prior to separation with my Ex (Alex). If you read this family report, you'll see that about half of it focuses on life prior to **now**, when Alex and I were still together living in the matrimonial home. For starters, this is irrelevant, as that was over 2 years ago and things have changes significantly, physically, mentally and emotionally. Things are mentioned in the report about how I played a husband role to the mother, however, this is no longer the case as not I am no longer a husband, this is the **past**, and **now** I am playing a sole parent role only. Not only this, the kids are no longer subjected to the constant bickering and arguments that they witnessed their parents practice on a daily basis. It means that the kids time spent with either parent can more of a **rich** experience than in the **past**, as each parent is somewhat happier. 

### Kids are kids, not adults

A ton of information throughout [this report](/marcseparation/the_report/) refers to what kids want, e.g. asking how much time the kids want to spend with each parent

### Single parent

[It is seriously hard to be a single parent](https://www.singlemothersurvivalguide.com/single-mom-tough/). You have to deal with all of the parental duties while juggling work, cleaning the house, cooking dinner, having relationships with others, and what happens if you get sick? You certainly cannot call in and take the day off from being a parent!

### Interactions with kids in front of the report writer

From 259 onwards in the report, where it talks about my interactions with the kids (my two kids Charlie & Chloe). The report writer seemed to have issues with the way that interacted with my kids. On the day in the report writers office, there were several challenges that we faced with the interactions with the kids.

1. There was just one double couch and that was it. We had an hour and we played cards. There was no table free, the only table available was full of papers and books on top of it and the report writer didn't proactivity offer to clear some space for us at all, she could see that i was trying to scramble to find a place to play cards, whereas she just sat there and provided no assistance at all. How are you meant to play cards on a double couch with 3 people? It's very difficult. I did ask the report writer shortly into the game if we could use the table, to which she reluctantly attempted to move things off of the table, but this seemed like an impossible task. So we were stuck on a couch. Wasn't the best environment for cards. We couldn't play on the floor, as I can't sit on the ground, I find it very uncomfortable sitting on the ground. 
2. It was very hot and stuffy with hardly any air circulating around the room. Wasn't the best conditions.
3. I was at the tail end of the sessions with the kids, I had the last session with the kids and by this stage the kids were over it, as they just spent 1 hour with their Mum in the same environment and no break in between. 

So keep this in mind when reading the sections from **259** onwards, it wasn't a great example of how the kids and I normally interact in the comfort of our own home. 

### Unfairly judged based on current time with the kids

 The other thing that we need to realise is that ever since Alex and I separated when I moved out of the family home in January 2020, I have only had the kids for 4 nights a fortnight VS what Alex's time is with the kids which is 10 nights a fortnight. We have to remember that this makes a huge difference in judging my time with the kids, as I don't get the same time with the kids that Alex does at **71.4%**, I only get the kids for **28.6%** of the time. 
 
 Alex has always been the primary caregiver, so that anytime I get the kids, there's always that adjustment period for the kids as we know both parents are total opposites of each other in terms of parenting.

 As Alex is already the **primary** caregiver by default and with 71.4% of time spent with the kids in the past 2 years, it's means that I am already the underdog. 

 - Kids will naturally have a better relationship with their mother, as they already have had **more time together**
 - The majority of money for the kids is spent by way of child support, **$2.4K~ / month is given to the mother**. As a father I don't have the luxury to spend the money on the kids directly e.g. buy as many day-to-day things for the kids, such as bikes or scooters etc. As the bulk of the money for the kids is paid direct to Alex and I don't get to experience first hand the enjoyment of the kids flourishing from this money being spent on them.
 - Not by choice, but as the stigma of men in family separations (people seem to think all men are physically violent), I was told to move out of my own home by my lawyer. As Alex is a female, authorities default stance is to side with her with any discrepancies between husband/wife. As **tenants in common** to the matrimonial home, both Alex and I are both 50/50 share of the home. All of my money is tied up in this property. Over the 8 years living in the matrimonial home I paid $303K~ of my own wages towards the mortgage of the matrimonial home where Alex paid none. It's meant that when I reluctantly moved out of the home in Jan 2020, I had no choice but to rent in an apartment ***temporarily*** (now going on 2 years) until this separation is totally completed. I have never wanted to rent in an apartment and it's always been my plan to buy another house in the area once this separation is finished. However, due to COVID-19, this has delayed things significantly in the court system and I have experienced unprecedented challenges during this time - time that I classify as **temporary**. It's due to this, Alex has had the upper hand with parenting ever since separation:
   - More room, such as a trampoline in the back yard
   - A back yard, more time spent outside
   - More storage space
     - I am paying extra on top of the apartment rent for a storage space at **National Storage** in Asquith. 
   - Much larger living area
   - Familiar environment for children
   - House Vs an apartment, quality of life is much better in a house
 
 Of course **I am greatly disadvantaged and unfairly judged** with this family report. The report focuses on the **now**, not the **future** for when my life is not **temporary** and it is back to normal. 

 As we look to the future, once the separation is over, my plan it take my money from the matrimonial house and buy another house, and it's then that my time with the kids can be much more quality time spent with the kids.

Born and raised in QLD to two loving parents. Father a CEO of large enterprises all his life and mostly stay at home mother that did everything around the home. Born June 6, 1976, now working at Microsoft. Bill Gates has Asperger's and Microsoft are setup for all types of people. Being heavily into diversity & inclusion, Microsoft is a great company to work for. With my Asperger's, I am doing great things at Microsoft and supported by my manager and my peers.

## No official Asperger's diagnosis

I say (**may**) have Asperger's syndrome, as it says from [Family Doctor](https://familydoctor.org/condition/aspergers-syndrome/) that there is no blood test or medical imaging scan to diagnose the Asperger's syndrome condition. Doctors compare a child’s behavior and development to a milestone checklist against same-age peers. For me, I simply filled out an Excel questionnaire and looked at the results, and I was about half way on the spectrum.

## Information about parents with Asperger's syndrome

Some highlights from a report about [parents with Asperger's](https://www.mghclaycenter.org/parenting-concerns/families/asperdad-growing-up-with-a-parent-on-the-autism-spectrum-maybe/) the report titled **AsperDad: Growing Up With a Parent on the Autism Spectrum**.

This is written by Hillary Hurst Bush, PhD. She is a clinical psychologist with expertise in the assessment of ASD. But also, she is the non-autistic child of someone on the autism spectrum.

**Hillary Hurst Bush** says:

> Based on my personal and professional experiences, there are some ways in which being on the autism spectrum can make parenting uniquely challenging: 
> 
> - **Navigating shifts in relationships with a partner/co-parent**. Raising a child involves many new responsibilities, and old patterns, schedules, and routines may no longer be feasible. This kind of adjustment can be very hard for parents on the autism spectrum. 
> - **Nuanced communication with a lot of new relations**. Raising a child involves interacting and forming relationships with many new people, including the child’s teachers, doctors, friends (and their parents), and other parents in less structured situations, like at the park. Managing these interactions and feeling confident in them can be challenging for parents on the autism spectrum.
> - **Highly sensory experiences**. Some aspects of child rearing are very demanding on the senses, including certain toys, foods, smells, and dirty diapers. What is “unpleasant” for someone who does not have autism can be “unbearable” or even physically painful for someone who does. 
> 
> Despite these challenges, there are some important ways in which being on the autism spectrum can be an asset in parenting: 
> 
> - **Structure, routine, and predictability**. Children often thrive when they have these things, and autistic parents are often well-equipped to provide them.
> - **Intense, passionate interests**. It is important for children to have models of adults pursuing their interests and passions. While I did not share all my dad’s interests, there are some activities, like fishing and skeet shooting, that we enjoyed together. In fact, these are some of the happiest memories I have with my dad. And, it is cool that they fall outside traditional gender expectations.
> - **Exposure to neurodiversity and acceptance of people who are different**. Research suggests that some siblings of people with ASD benefit from these unique relationships, and more is needed to know if this is true for children of people with ASD too. 


## Scientific research for shared parenting

The following [taken from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_parenting#Scientific_research):

Epidemiological studies on the effect of shared parenting on children has been conducted using both cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs. Their conclusions are that **children with a shared parenting arrangement have better physical, mental, social and academic outcomes** compared to children in a primary parenting arrangement. These finding holds for all age groups, whether the parents have an amicable or high-conflict relationship, and after adjusting for socio-economic variables.

With its early adoption of shared parenting and excellent health data, the largest studies on shared parenting have been conducted in Sweden. In a large cross-sectional study comparing over 50,000 children, ages 12 and 15, living in either a shared or sole custody arrangement, **Dr. Malin Bergström** found that **children with shared parenting had better outcomes for physical health, psychological well-being, moods and emotions, self-perception, autonomy, parental relations, material outcomes, peer relations, school satisfaction and social acceptance**. Using data from the same cross-sectional survey, Bergström did a follow-up study focusing on psychosomatic problems of concentration, sleeping, headaches, stomach aches, tenseness, lack of appetite, sadness and dizziness. They found that **both boys and girls did better living in a shared parenting versus sole custody arrangement**. Both studies adjusted for selected socio-economic variables.

A review of 60 quantitative research studies found that in 34 of the studies, **children in a shared parenting arrangement had better outcomes on all measured variables for well-being, most notably for their family relationships, physical health, adolescent behaviour and mental health**. In 14 studies, they had better or equal outcomes on all measures, in 6 studies that had equal outcomes on all measures, and in 6 studies that had worse outcomes on one measure and equal or better outcomes on the remaining measures. The results were similar for the subset of studies that adjusted for socio-economic variables and the level of conflict between parents. The variable with the smallest difference was academic achievement, for which only 3 out 10 studies showed an advantage for shared parenting.[5] Studies indicate that children fare better in joint custody arrangements, or where they have good access to both parents, as compared to sole custody arrangements.
