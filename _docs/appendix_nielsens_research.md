Nielsen’s research debunks many popular, but false and damaging, beliefs about fathers and fathering after parents separate. As her research shows…

- Children who live primarily with their mothers have worse emotional, physical, academic, and behavioral outcomes than children who live with their fathers 35%-50% time in a shared parenting custody arrangement.  
  
- Shared parenting children have better outcomes even when their parents do not have a cooperative, friendly relationship and even when one parent initially opposed the shared parenting custody plan.
  
- Infants, toddlers and preschoolers have better outcomes when they live in a shared parenting family.
  
- Infants and toddlers who spend frequent overnight time with their dads are not more irritable, more poorly behaved, or more insecurely attached to their mothers than those with little to no overnight fathering time.

**Note**: Currently, I only get the kids for 28.6% of the time.
