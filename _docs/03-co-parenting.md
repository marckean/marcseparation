The current co-parenting is not working. Alex is under pressure and is not coping, adopting the [hands-off parenting approach](/marcseparation/alex_parenting/#alex-is-never-around) that her own mother took. The 28.6% of the time that I have the kids, there's been on-going health issues with Chloe. 

- Chloe constantly has a sore tummy, for the past 2 years, something is causing it and Alex has done nothing to look into it properly other than band-aid fixes
- Chloe has had a niggling cough for 4+ months, never went away. Alex hasn't done anything about it, I bought cough medicine which did seem to help somewhat, but she needs to be taken to ENT specialist to look into it further
- Chloe constantly has issues with her mouth, trouble swallowing certain foods and Alex does nothing about fixing it. 

I call it this this **temporary phase of life**, a **holding pattern** so to speak, the time between separation (Nov 2019) and a final hearing/settlement. This has been going on for over two years now. Seems to me that in this **holding pattern**, Alex is clutching on for dear life with the [minimal money that she has](/marcseparation/child_support/#alex-wages) and spending a tone of money in legal costs, meanwhile she's [heavily dependant on me for child support](/marcseparation/child_support/#child-support-alex-is-receiving-from-me) to live day-to-day and the kids are neglected with on-going health issues that need to be properly looked at, any money she does have is not being properly spent on the kids, it's being spent in legal bills. 

As I pointed out, the [living conditions of the matrimonial home](/marcseparation/living_conditions/), its's disgusting, the house is way too big for her to manage by herself, the amount of mortgage that Alex is paying, Alex is in well over her head and why? Because she's holding, clutching at straws and holding onto this **holding pattern**, a fake reality while it lasts, but it's not sustainable and as I have documented both [here](/marcseparation/living_conditions/) and [here](https://marckean.github.io/marcseparation/living_comparisons/), things are starting to fall apart for Alex. 

Alex is not coping.
## General events

### March 4, 2021 Communicating via the kids

- Charlie tells me Mums plan, expecting me to pay $200 for his birthday, towards a new bike
- After I question Charlie about the issue with his current bike, he doesn’t need a new bike, he just needs his current bike adjusted, the handle bars can go up.

### March 9, 2021 No respect, & comms via the kids

- I go to the house to drop off kids sports uniforms
- Alex greets me at the door with a foul look on her face, abuses me, tells me - I forgot the kids sneakers and doesn’t even say thank you
- She doesn’t even say thank you
- Charlie calls me later on Wednesday night and asks me about his shoes, I tell him to speak to Mummy to sort it out and then all of a sudden he hangs up on me which is totally out of character for him
- Straight after, Alex calls me and abuses me, what did I do, Charlie is in tears and I just hung up on her
- I find out later on Thursday from Charlie that Alex was with him at the time when he called and it was Alex that hung up on me
