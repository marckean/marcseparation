## Statements from the report

![](../blobs/childsupport/report_alex_children_financial_gain.jpg)

- I say in the report that Alex is using the Children for financial gain

![](../blobs/childsupport/report_alex_child_support.jpg)

- Then Alex practically spells it out, she's not willing to allow me more time with the kids as then she gets less money from child support and screws up her plans for a mortgage


## My rebuttal

Ever since separation, Alex hasn't managed to get a full-time job and move on with her life. Even though Alex and I have separated, she is still heavily dependant on me for finances. 

### Alex wages

Alex earns $32K~ / year, Vs me who earns $168K~ year. Alex clears about $500~ / week after tax and has chosen to remain in a part time job ever since separation (Nov 2019) and relies on the Child Support Money that she gets from me in order to remain in the matrimonial home.

### Mortgage repayments for the matrimonial home as of Jan 2022

| Mortgage Account Number | Repayments |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 461921769 | $493.00 per month |
| 779844644 | $1,777.00 per month |

### Child Support Alex is receiving from me 

Alex gets $2.2K Child Support per month from me. Alex pays me nothing to me in return.

As we've already [demonstrated and established](/marcseparation/alex_parenting/), Alex's way of parenting is just like how her own mother parented her, very much hands-off. Alex doesn't care about the kids so much, as mush as she cares about how much money that she can get by having the kids for most of the time. 

Think about it, there's no way that if the matrimonial home is sold that Alex would be able to get a loan, no bank would loan her any money with a part time job earning peanuts. As per above, Alex has admitted it herself, the child support money she receives from me right now, based on the current time that she has the kids, is what she so heavily relies on in order to pay the mortgage. She **needs the kids** for the period of time the kids are with her now, just so she can get enough money to pay the mortgage. **Alex is using the children for financial gain** plain and simple, and outside of this doesn't really care about the kids, as [Alex's parenting style is very hands-off](/marcseparation/alex_parenting/#alex-is-never-around).

Alex is milking the system to her own personal advantage - not in the kids best interest.

Why else did she and her friend Bec go to so much trouble and tell the report writer so much about me being a bad Dad. The report writer, also female, listened to them and was sold on what they both had to say.

Remember that I separated with Alex, not the kids. I love my kids to bits, why else would I go to so much trouble in putting this site together. I don't have an issue spending money on the kids, but I do have an issue spending money for the kids from behind the scenes via Alex, [I don't even get the pleasure of seeing my children benefit from the spending](/appendix_5050_custody/#7-financial-resources-are-shared-naturally).
