## Statements from the report

The report contained the following:

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report1.png)

- *He already has failed to make his time a rich one for the children with child centered experiences*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report2.png)

- *Rather than picking up the que that they needed to go outside and do physical activity together*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report3.png)

- *The Fathers difficulty in understanding the age-appropriate needs of his children*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report4.png)

- *The inflexibility which is due to his neurodevelopmental disorder is a major deficit to his ability to relate to all people and in particular his own children*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report5.png)

- *The father's nature of having less emotional understanding and his own concrete beliefs about what they need, has meant he has cut himself off from them psychologically*

- I checked and confirmed the rules for Uno

- Advising my kids that they need to follow rules

- I produced rules for my kids

- The report writer is having a go at me for getting rules out in a game
## My rebuttal

### Rules in games

The report writer having a go at me for reading the rules for games, this is totally absurd. The report writer said, "*This certainly prolonged the games and changed the tone from fun to serious instead of light-hearted. I had never seen a father respond in such a rule-bound way*.". This video here is taken of my own Dad (Poppy to my kids) and he is reading rules for a game called **Bobs**. I then go onto ask Charlie is he is happy with the game, to which he replies, *yes*:

It's ok for others to read rules. My brother in law (my sisters husband) always refers to rules when playing games so there's no arguments, fights or disagreements. It's not OK for me? [Bearing in mind the conditions of the room when I interacted with the kids](/my_initial_comments/#interactions-with-kids-in-front-of-the-report-writer), it wasn't the best environment for playing card games at all.  

Reading rules is not a constant thing, it's only needed generally once when someone is unsure of the game and it makes sure that it sets good habits for kids, so they don't grow up playing games the wrong way with the risk that they end up in an argument, fight or disagreement with their peers when playing games. 

On the subject of games (e.g. Bobs), having fun and the kids getting really involved in the game. Here's a video of both **Charlie** & **Chloe**, they are both right into the game of **Bobs**. I ask them how to play, and as their Poppy read the **rules** to them, they were **happy** to explain how to play the game while they themselves played the game itself:

### Fun things I have done with my kids

Since separation, the kids and Dad have done many fun things together.

- I am a fun and the kids love being with me & their extended paternal family
- Photos all of which since separation (since Nov 2019)
- Kids are more than happy and at piece with themselves

### BIG4 Ingenia holiday park

Other fun things I do with the kids, I made a fun tourist video with the kids when we stayed recently at the BIG4 Ingenia Holiday park in Soldiers Point NSW, near Port Stephens, just north east of Newcastle. Kids had a whole bunch of fun making it. See the video here:
