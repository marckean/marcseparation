This is both Charlie & Chloe pushing me around on the spinning thing at the park. We all loved it so much. 

## Statements from the report

The report contained the following:

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report6.png)

- Alex said about me "*He really loves them and he wouldn't hurt them. There is no domestic violence*"

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report1.png)

- *He already has failed to make his time a rich one for the children with child centred experiences*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report2.png)

- *Rather than picking up the cue that they needed to go outside and do physical activity together*
- **Comment from my Mum, the paternal grandmother** - saying the kids needed to go outside is just a statement…. They do what children do, annoy each other… They should also be able to entertain themselves – they shouldn’t need a parent to constantly amuse them.   Where is the credibility in the statement ‘*picking up the cue that they needed to go outside and do physical activity together*’…..     that is just a generalised statement… There are times when children just need to do what is asked – they are too young to realise the reasoning behind a request – they can have opinions, but ultimately the parent should make the decision.    What they do in their free time, is entirely their choice…


![](../blobs/lovedad/Report3.png)

- *The Fathers difficulty in understanding the age-appropriate needs of his children*

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report4.png)

- *The inflexibility which is due to his neurodevelopmental disorder is a major deficit to his ability to relate to all people and in particular his own children*
- **Comment from my Mum, the paternal grandmother** - Saying the father ‘*is inflexible due to his neurodevelopmental disorder*’ is just an excuse… The children know what they are likely to get away with and are quite capable of communicating.

![](../blobs/lovedad/Report5.png)

- *The father's nature of having less emotional understanding and his own concrete beliefs about what they need, has meant he has cut himself off from them psychologically*
- **Comment from my Mum, the paternal grandmother** - Of course the children have spent more time with their mother throughout their lives – that is what usually happens.  The father works and supports the family…  The children had plenty of time to communicate well with their father – and did so… He was quite well aware of what was happening in the house.

## My rebuttal

### Fun things I have done with my kids

Since separation, the kids and Dad have done many fun things together.

- I am a fun and the kids love being with me & their extended paternal family
- Photos all of which since separation (since Nov 2019)
- Kids are more than happy and at peace with themselves

### BIG4 Ingenia holiday park

Other fun things I do with the kids, I made a fun tourist video with the kids when we stayed recently at the BIG4 Ingenia Holiday park in Soldiers Point NSW, near Port Stephens, just north east of Newcastle. Kids had a whole bunch of fun making it. See the video here:

### Encouraging kids to hit other kids

#### The report

![](../blobs/lovedad/report_kids_bullying1.png)

### My rebuttal

The real story here. I am a big believer of self-defence, it's ok to defend yourself as long as it wasn't you that started it. I was always told as a kid to stand up for myself. I did a pretty crap job at it, but I was a big believer in it. Teachers won't be around everywhere to protect you, so I wanted my kids to learn this early in life, start early and develop good habits themselves rather than rely on **teachers** for example that won't be around all their life. I told the kids many times that if anyone hit them at school, hit them back straight away within a millisecond and say "*no*" in a big voice. I also told them very clearly to **never be the first one to hit** and **only** if someone hits them, then hit them back instantly. The thought process here is that the kids bullying doing the hitting in the first place will learn very quickly not to target kids that stand up for themselves, and then the bullier will move onto to the next kid. It's like the old saying with security in homes, the thieves breaking into homes, if your house is fully secure and locked up, they'll move on and target the weakest house. Same with a bullier, they'll tend to target the weakest and easiest kid.
