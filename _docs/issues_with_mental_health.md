Alex has mental issues - the below is a summary of real events, which have been documented at the time of the events happening
	· Alex runs on auto-pilot, her brain is not engaged on things that she's doing
	· Alex runs on subconscious and is not conscious most of the time 
	· The house just about burns down
	· The house is constantly left unlocked

### Alex's crap carpark

On December 16, 2020 look how far out from the gutter that she parked on an already narrow street in the middle of school pickup

### Chloe dropped face first onto a tiled floor
When our daughter was a little baby and still in nappies. Alex was changing her nappy in the laundry, Alex put Chloe on the bench face up. Alex turns her back for a second, then Chloe roles off the bench and goes splat onto the tiled floor face down. Chloe would have fallen about 1+ meters.


Saying stuff which is in-correct, doesn't give me the correct answer

### The grass that was for sale

I ask Alex "Do we have the money for the grass?"    She says, "Yes"
I ask where is it, she says "In the office"
I ask where abouts is it in the office, she says "it'll be dropped off to the office"

### Private Health Insurance

Half way through November I asked Alex to cancel the health cover (under her name) cover for her and the kids. Alex paid this using money out of the joint account $1.9K (after separation) she took our money to pay for her health cover, this included cover for both Alex and the kids (I’m not paying for Alex's cover), I asked this same night if she had reversed the health cover and she said YES! She said the money would be back in my account in a couple of days. Just now (2 weeks later) the money is still not back in the account, however the money has been transferred to a completely separate account in her name - which I don't have access to.
