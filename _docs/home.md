The idea of this site is to look at each aspects of the family report (aka. Chapter 15 expert report) and break it down. 

There's no **facts** in this report, it's all people's **opinions**. Opinions are not facts. I'll be doing my best on this site to break down each **opinion** against me, then dissolve the **opinion** with a **fact**. 

Main navigation is to the left, and I have grouped each section to make it easier to follow. Within each page, there's a page menu to the right, for more deeper navigation within the page itself.
