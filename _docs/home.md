## Prologue

### The rights of the child

As per [Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://www.unicef.org.au/our-work/information-for-children/un-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child):

Children should not be separated from their parents unless it is for their own good. For example, if a parent is mistreating or neglecting
a child. Children whose parents have separated have the right to stay in contact with both parents, unless this might harm the child.

1. States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child's place of residence.

2. In any proceedings pursuant to paragraph 1 of the present article, all interested parties shall be given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings and make their views known.

3. States Parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child's best interests.

4. Where such separation results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a request shall of itself entail no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned.

#### An international agreement for child rights

Thirty years ago, world leaders made a historic commitment to the world’s children by adopting the **United Nations** Convention on the **Rights of the Child** – an international agreement on childhood.

It’s become the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history and has helped transform children’s lives around the world.

### The Family Report - why we're here

The idea of this site is to look at each aspects of the [family report](/marcseparation/the_report/) (aka. Chapter 15 expert report) and break it down, one by one. The other idea of having this site was the fact that it's on the internet, everyone has internet access, it's all in the one place, point and click, no fumbling around for papers, it's all in the one place, fast, fluid and easy to access on any device. 

**Note:** this site is publicly accessible only if you have the direct URL, it is not indexed on any search engine. As an example, you cannot search for phrases from this site in Google. 

Just as I stood up after my session with **Ruth Selig** about to walk out, she looked me in the eye and told me that she's dealt with cases much worse than ours and that I'd have a good chance getting more time with the kids. However, after speaking with Alex's friend Bec (**Rebecca Illis**) things changed. There's clearly a strong influence from the other people who followed me, e.g. Alex's friend **Rebecca Illis** (Bec).

There's no **facts** in this report, it's all people's **opinions**. Opinions are not **facts**. Courts deal with **facts**. I'll be doing my best on this site to break down each and every **opinion** against me, then dissolve the **opinion** with a **fact**. 

There's no denying, the bulk of this report is against me and makes me look like a real monster of a Dad - I'm not a monster of a Dad. There's things that been ignored, taken out of context, spoken words not recorded clearly from what was mentioned in the room with a clear skewed view based on influence from particular people interviewed. 

It's blatantly obvious that it's war and that both Alex and her friend Bec are completely against me. It's also true that with my Asperger's people read me the wrong way and many people tell me that they can't read me at all, it looks like the report writer Ruth also couldn't read me correctly me, miss interpreted me completely with two non Asperger's people that followed me, it's no wonder this report is totally out of wack. 

Report writers need to remain neutral and leave all emotions out completely with these things - not the case here. There's a tone of things incorrect and this site is here to bring it all out in the open by using photos, audio and videos - media in these formats doesn't lie. 
### How to use this site

Main navigation is to the left, and I have grouped each section to make it easier to follow. 

![](./blobs/navigation_main.png)

Within each page, there's a page menu to the right, for more deeper navigation within the page itself.

I would recommend to start by reading [My Initial Comments](/marcseparation/my_initial_comments/). 

Couple of things that I will highlight to keep in mind across all of this site:

- Since separation, Alex is already the **primary** caregiver by default and with 71.4% of time spent with the kids in the past 2 years
- Kids will naturally have a better relationship with their mother, as they already have had **more time together**
