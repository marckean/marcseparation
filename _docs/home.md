The idea of this site is to look at each aspects of the family report (aka. Chapter 15 expert report) and break it down. 

There's no **facts** in this report, it's all people's **opinions**. Opinions are not facts. I'll be doing my best on this site to break down each **opinion** against me, then dissolve the **opinion** with a **fact**. 

Main navigation is to the left, and I have grouped each section to make it easier to follow. Within each page, there's a page menu to the right, for more deeper navigation within the page itself. 

Start by reading [My Initial Comments](/marcseparation/my_initial_comments/). 

Couple of things that I will highlight to keep in mind across all of this site:

- Since separation, Alex is already the **primary** caregiver by default and with 71.4% of time spent with the kids in the past 2 years
- Kids will naturally have a better relationship with their mother, as they already have had **more time together**
