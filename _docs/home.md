The idea of this site is to look at each aspects of the family report (aka. Chapter 15 expert report) and break it down, one by one. The other idea of having this site was the fact that it's on the internet, everyone has internet access, it's all in the one place, point and click, no fumbling around for papers, it's all in the one place, fast, fluid and easy to access on any device. 

**Note:** this site is publicly accessible only if you have the direct URL, it is not indexed on any search engine.

Just as I stood up after my session with **Ruth Selig** about to walk out, she looked me in the eye and told me that she's dealt with cases much worse than ours and that I'd have a good chance getting more time with the kids. However, after speaking with Alex's friend Bec (**Rebecca Illis**) things changed. 

There's no **facts** in this report, it's all people's **opinions**. Opinions are not **facts**. Courts deal with **facts**. I'll be doing my best on this site to break down each **opinion** against me, then dissolve the **opinion** with a **fact**. 

### How to use this site

Main navigation is to the left, and I have grouped each section to make it easier to follow.

Within each page, there's a page menu to the right, for more deeper navigation within the page itself.

I would recommend to start by reading [My Initial Comments](/marcseparation/my_initial_comments/). 

Couple of things that I will highlight to keep in mind across all of this site:

- Since separation, Alex is already the **primary** caregiver by default and with 71.4% of time spent with the kids in the past 2 years
- Kids will naturally have a better relationship with their mother, as they already have had **more time together**
