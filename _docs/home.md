## My summary of the report
### Focus on previous life
If you read this family report, you'll see that about half of it focuses on life prior to now, when Alex and I were still together living in the matrimonial home. For starters, this is irrelevant, as that was over 2 years ago and things have changes significantly. Things are said in the report about how I played a husband role to the mother, this is no longer the case as not I am no longer a husband and playing a sole parent role only. Not only this, the kids are not subjected to the constant bickering and arguments that they witnessed their parents practice on a daily basis. 

### Time with the kids

 The other thing that we need to realise is that ever since Alex and I separated when I moved out of the family home in January 2020, I have only had the kids for 4 nights a fortnight Vs what Alex's time with the kids which is 10 nights a fortnight. We have to remember that this makes a hue difference in judging my time with the kids, as I don't get the same time with the kids that Alex does at **71.4%**, I only get the kids for **28.6%** of the time. 
 
 Alex has always been the primary caregiver, so that anytime I get the kids, there's always that adjustment period for the kids as we know both parents are total opposites of each other in terms of parenting.

 As Alex is already the **primary** care giver by default and with 71.4% of time spent with the kids in the past 2 years, it's means that I am already the underdog. 

 - Kids will naturally have a better relationship with their mother, as they have **more time together**
 - The majority of money for the kids is spend by way of child support, **$2.4K~ / month is given to the mother**. As a father I don't have the luxury to buy as many things for the kids, such as bikes or scooters etc.
 - Not by choice, but as the stigma of men in family separations (people seem to think all men are physically violent), I was told to move out by my lawyer. As Alex is a female, authorities default stance is to side with her with any discrepancies between husband/wife. As **tenants in common** to the matrimonial home, both Alex and I are both 50/50 share of the home. All of my money is tied up in this property. Over the 8 years living in the matrimonial home I paid $303~ of my own wages towards the mortgage of the matrimonial home where Alex paid none. It's meant that when I reluctantly moved out of the home in Jan 2020, I had no choice but to rent in an apartment ***temporarily*** (now going on 2 years) until this separation is totally completed. I have never wanted to rent in an apartment and it's always been my plan to buy another house in the area once this separation is finished. However due to COVID-19, this has delayed things significantly in the court system and I have experienced unprecedented challenges during this time classed as temporary. It's due to this, Alex has had the upper hand with parenting ever since separation:
   - More room, such as a trampoline in the back yard
   - A back yard, more time spent outside
   - More storage space
     - I am paying extra on top of the apartment rent for a storage space at **National Storage** in Asquith. 
   - Much larger living area
   - Familiar environment for children
   - House Vs an apartment, quality of life is much better in a house
 
 Of course **I am greatly disadvantaged and unfairly judged** with this family report. The report focuses on the **now**, not the **future** for when my life is not **temporary** and it is back to normal. 

 As we look to the future, once the separation is over, my plan it take my money from the matrimonial house and buy another house, and it's then that my time with the kids can be much more quality time spent with the kids.
 
 ## About Marc Kean

![Marc](./blobs/Marc-17.jpg)

This family report does a great job in discrediting me as a father with Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's syndrome is very common and very highly successful people have Asperger's syndrome, e.g. Bill Gates & Elon Musk. Likewise, I shouldn't be penalised as a father just because I **may** have Asperger's syndrome. 

## No official Asperger's diagnosis

I say (**may**) have Asperger's syndrome, as it says from [Family Doctor](https://familydoctor.org/condition/aspergers-syndrome/) that there is no blood test or medical imaging scan to diagnose the Asperger's syndrome condition. Doctors compare a child’s behavior and development to a milestone checklist against same-age peers. For me, I simply filled out an Excel questionnaire and looked at the results, and I was about half way on the spectrum.

## Information about parents with Asperger's syndrome

Some highlights from a report about [parents with Asperger's](https://www.mghclaycenter.org/parenting-concerns/families/asperdad-growing-up-with-a-parent-on-the-autism-spectrum-maybe/) the report titled **AsperDad: Growing Up With a Parent on the Autism Spectrum**.

This is written by Hillary Hurst Bush, PhD. She is a clinical psychologist with expertise in the assessment of ASD. But also, she is the non-autistic child of someone on the autism spectrum.

She says:

Based on my personal and professional experiences, there are some ways in which being on the autism spectrum can make parenting uniquely challenging: 

- **Navigating shifts in relationships with a partner/co-parent**. Raising a child involves many new responsibilities, and old patterns, schedules, and routines may no longer be feasible. This kind of adjustment can be very hard for parents on the autism spectrum. 
- **Nuanced communication with a lot of new relations**. Raising a child involves interacting and forming relationships with many new people, including the child’s teachers, doctors, friends (and their parents), and other parents in less structured situations, like at the park. Managing these interactions and feeling confident in them can be challenging for parents on the autism spectrum.
- **Highly sensory experiences**. Some aspects of child rearing are very demanding on the senses, including certain toys, foods, smells, and dirty diapers. What is “unpleasant” for someone who does not have autism can be “unbearable” or even physically painful for someone who does. 

Despite these challenges, there are some important ways in which being on the autism spectrum can be an asset in parenting: 

- **Structure, routine, and predictability**. Children often thrive when they have these things, and autistic parents are often well-equipped to provide them.
- **Intense, passionate interests**. It is important for children to have models of adults pursuing their interests and passions. While I did not share all my dad’s interests, there are some activities, like fishing and skeet shooting, that we enjoyed together. In fact, these are some of the happiest memories I have with my dad. And, it is cool that they fall outside traditional gender expectations.
- **Exposure to neurodiversity and acceptance of people who are different**. Research suggests that some siblings of people with ASD benefit from these unique relationships, and more is needed to know if this is true for children of people with ASD too.
