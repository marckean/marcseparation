## About Marc Kean

![Marc](/blobs/Marc-17.jpg)

This family report does a great job in discrediting me as a father with Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's syndrome is very common and very highly successful people have Asperger's syndrome, e.g. Bill Gates & Elon Musk. Likewise, I shouldn't be penalised as a father just because I **may** have Asperger's syndrome. 

## Official Diagnosis

I say (**may**) have Asperger's syndrome, as it says from [Family Doctor](https://familydoctor.org/condition/aspergers-syndrome/) that there is no blood test or medical imaging scan to diagnose the Asperger's syndrome condition. Doctors compare a child’s behavior and development to a milestone checklist against same-age peers. For me, I simply filled out an Excel questionnaire and looked at the results, and I was about half way on the spectrum.

## Information about parents with Asperger's syndrome

Some highlights from a report about [parents with Asperger's](https://www.mghclaycenter.org/parenting-concerns/families/asperdad-growing-up-with-a-parent-on-the-autism-spectrum-maybe/) the report titled **AsperDad: Growing Up With a Parent on the Autism Spectrum**.

This is written by Hillary Hurst Bush, PhD. She is a clinical psychologist with expertise in the assessment of ASD. But also, she is the non-autistic child of someone on the autism spectrum.

She says:

Based on my personal and professional experiences, there are some ways in which being on the autism spectrum can make parenting uniquely challenging: 

- **Navigating shifts in relationships with a partner/co-parent**. Raising a child involves many new responsibilities, and old patterns, schedules, and routines may no longer be feasible. This kind of adjustment can be very hard for parents on the autism spectrum. 
- **Nuanced communication with a lot of new relations**. Raising a child involves interacting and forming relationships with many new people, including the child’s teachers, doctors, friends (and their parents), and other parents in less structured situations, like at the park. Managing these interactions and feeling confident in them can be challenging for parents on the autism spectrum.
- **Highly sensory experiences**. Some aspects of child rearing are very demanding on the senses, including certain toys, foods, smells, and dirty diapers. What is “unpleasant” for someone who does not have autism can be “unbearable” or even physically painful for someone who does. 

Despite these challenges, there are some important ways in which being on the autism spectrum can be an asset in parenting: 

- **Structure, routine, and predictability**. Children often thrive when they have these things, and autistic parents are often well-equipped to provide them.
- **Intense, passionate interests**. It is important for children to have models of adults pursuing their interests and passions. While I did not share all my dad’s interests, there are some activities, like fishing and skeet shooting, that we enjoyed together. In fact, these are some of the happiest memories I have with my dad. And, it is cool that they fall outside traditional gender expectations.
- **Exposure to neurodiversity and acceptance of people who are different**. Research suggests that some siblings of people with ASD benefit from these unique relationships, and more is needed to know if this is true for children of people with ASD too.
