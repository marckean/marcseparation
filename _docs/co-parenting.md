The current co-parenting is not working

## General events

### March 4, 2021 Communicating via the kids

- Charlie tells me Mums plan, expecting me to pay $200 for his birthday, towards a new bike
- After I question Charlie about the issue with his current bike, he doesn’t need a new bike, he just needs his current bike adjusted, the handle bars can go up.

### March 9, 2021 No respect, & comms via the kids

- I go to the house to drop off kids sports uniforms
- Alex greets me at the door with a fowl look on her face, abuses me, tells me - I forgot the kids sneakers and doesn’t even say thank you
- She doesn’t even say thank you
- Charlie calls me later on Wednesday night and asks me about his shoes, I tell him to speak to Mummy to sort it out and then all of a sudden he hangs up on me which is totally out of character for him
- Straight after, Alex calls me and abuses me, what did I do, Charlie is in tears and I just hung up on her
- I find out later on Thursday from Charlie that Alex was with him at the time when he called and it was Alex that hung up on me
