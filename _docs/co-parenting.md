- She doesn’t even say thank you
- Charlie calls me later on Wednesday night and asks me about his shoes, I tell him to speak to Mummy to sort it out and then all of a sudden he hangs up on me which is totally out of character for him
- Straight after, Alex calls me and abuses me, what did I do, Charlie is in tears and I just hung up on her
- I find out later on Thursday from Charlie that Alex was with him at the time when he called and it was Alex that hung up on me
