## Statements from the report

![](../blobs/beckids/report_bec_kids.png)

## My rebuttal



- By default Charlie calls Bec within an instant when he can't get hold of his Mum on the phone - as seen [here](/marcseparation/alex_mental_health/#matrimonial-home-totally-unlocked-january-16-2022), you can hear it in the background in the video
  - Seems that Bec's done a great job in building credibility with my kids
- No parental controls on the kids devices, as per [here](/marcseparation/report_missed_mentions/#parental-controls-on-devices)
  - Great that Bec gives iPads/devices to the kids, but they are not safe
- Bec was fully naked in front of my son Charlie as per [here](/marcseparation/dad_is_a_good_dad/#statements-from-the-report). When I had a chat to Charlie the other day about whether he's seen Bec topless before, both **Charlie & Chloe** said that it's still happening and even as recently as in a couple of weeks ago.
