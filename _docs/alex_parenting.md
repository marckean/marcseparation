Alex Parenting


No structure
- Alex never had proper structure growing up.
- The kids need structure, then need to learn routine

No discipline
- The children are left to their own devices
- When I get the kids before they adjust, they don’t do what they’re told
- Charlie tells me ‘No’
- Kids run amuck around the shops touching everything, I tell them look but not touch and to not run around as there’s elderly people that they need to look out for and respect
- Aunty Vic - 5 star hotel pool. 


Fear & Uncomfortable
- Vic saying “He’s such a dickhead” about Marc, in front of the kids. The kids felt very uncomfortable. 

Living arrangements
- Back yard grass edges is a mess and out of control, the kids complain about always getting leeches from the back yard. 
- House is constantly unlocked, we back on to bush 

Chloe sick
- Constantly has a sore tummy, for the past 2 years, something is causing it and Alex has done nothing to look into it
- Chloe had a niggling cough for 4 months, never went away. Alex didn’t do anything about it, I bought cough medicine which got rid of it. 
- Chloe constantly had issues with her mouth and Alex does nothing about fixing it
