## Introduction:

2. This case revolves around the children Marc Kean (DOB: 06/06/1976) and Alexandra Spence (DOB: 11/08/1975). The children are Charlie Kean (DOB: 06/07/2011) and Chloe Kean (DOB: 03/07/2013).

3. The children have been living with the mother in the matrimonial home in Asquith and having contact time as per Interim Orders two nights a week, either Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday nights.

4. The father was seeking more time with the children and the mother was seeking the same or less time for the father.

5. There is currently no financial settlement and the father appeared to wish to sell the family home whereas the mother wished to buy out his share and remain where she was with the children.

6. The parents agreed that the father has Asperger's Syndrome (Autism Spectrum Disorder). He worked in IT at Microsoft.

7. The mother worked as a receptionist and rental property manager at Century 21 Real Estate agency in Cremorne.

8. The maternal aunt, Victoria, lived with her husband and the children's two cousins, Henry and Chelsea, _nearby in Asquith.

9. The maternal grandparents have passed away. The paternal grandparents live in Queensland on the Sunshine Coast.

10. Currently, the father was renting a unit in Chatswood and working from home.


## The mother:
Alexandra Spence - DOB: 11/08/1975

12. Alexandra Spence was a 47-year-old real estate property manager who lived with the children, Charlie, 10, and Chloe, 8, at the matrimonial home in Asquith. She worked from home five days a week including Saturday mornings.

13. I asked the mother, in her own words, what the case was about. She said it was to work out the percentage of time the children spent with her as compared to the father.

14. She said that, currently, the children were having four nights a fortnight and half the school holidays with the father.

15. I asked her if that suited her. She said: "It is hardest for the children in the (summer) school holidays because they have three weeks in a row." She said she would prefer the children to have weekabout shared care during the six-week summer holiday. She said that Chloe, who is only eight, had struggled in the past after couple of days and texted her mother saying how she missed h(!r. ·
 

16. I asked if the children had Facetime or phone contact while they were with the father. She said recently the children had been given their own mobile phones and they usually texted her rather than telephone, but she rang them at night to say goodnight.

17. I summarised and said: "So your concerns are for the duration of contact not for the quality of contact?" She agreed and said that she would be happy with alternating weeks during the Christmas holidays. She told me that the father would prefer a block of three weeks which she felt was harder on the children.

18. I asked her if she had any plans to take the children away for the holidays. She said: "Somewhere local, maybe to the Hunter Valley.·"

19. I asked her about the children. She told me that Charlie was in Year 4 and Chloe was in Year 3 at Asquith Public School.

20. I asked her what Charlie was like. She said he was very athletic and sociable; loved being busy with his friends and going to the park. She said that he "created a scooter group at the park with his cousin Henry" who is 18 months older and that he goes to the park every day with friends. He also plays tennis. When asked what Chloe was like, the mother said she was a "high achiever" and loved to pretend play, play with dolls' houses and prams and liked to have social catch ups with her school friends, her cousin Chelsea. Chloe and Chelsea were very close. She also liked to go on the trampoline, the scooter, to ride bikes and preferred structured life more than Charlie did.

21. The mother went on to say that she and Chloe were extremely close, that they do baking together, reading together and "she hangs out with me a lot". Chloe also played tennis with her friends.

22. I asked if they did any formal extracurricular activities. She said that Charlie played basketball but they will also arrange a tennis day as there were tennis courts adjoining the back of their property.

23. The mother told me that she worked on Saturdays and so either her sister, Victoria, or her close friend Rebecca, known as Bee, would look after the children on Saturday morning for a few hours.

24. Charlie also belonged to Cubs and had persisted with it throughout the lockdown when they held Zoom meetings, learning how to tie knots and make a mess in the kitchen, such as making slime. She said she was hopeful that cricket and basketball would resume for Charlie who had been in the Waitara teams for Saturday morning sport. She said that Chloe was also going to start basketball but she and Chelsea would go to the park as well and just hang around together while Henry and Charlie were playing basketball.

25. The mother told me that Chloe wanted to do tennis more seriously and attend tennis camps in the school holidays. She had also taken up T-ball and done hip hop dancing.

26. I asked how home schooling had been during the recent COVID lockdown. The mother said that, fortunately her employer was extremely supportive, and that there was no pressure for her to be available between 9.00am and 3.00pm, her usual working hours, as long as she got the work done. She said that she was able to dedicate the time to home schooling, which was important for Chloe, but as Charlie was slightly more independent, he did not need quite as much supervision as Chloe.

27. She also felt it was important to keep the children active during the lockdown, encouraging them to do trampolining time and going to the park every day.

28. The mother said they had "amazing teachers" who weren't pressuring them to do academic pursuits during the lockdown but were more worried about the children's mental health, encouraging them to do two hours of physical exercise a day.

29. The children were seeing their teachers only about one day a week but the mother would help them do the assigned homework and lessons and would alternate doing academic studies such as comprehension poems with physical activity.

30. I asked how the children responded to contact with their father. The mother told me that Chloe prepared herself before she went; that they do a countdown at night and, usually the night before they go to their father's, the children sleep in bed with their mother and say that they would miss her. While they are away Chloe would text her mother saying, "I miss you so much," sending crying emojis, which the mother felt was typical of an eight-year-old girl.

31. I asked if the mother thought Chloe was anxious or oversensitive. She said she was "a little bit anxious" but she felt it was important to give Chloe a calendar so that she could see when she would be going to her father's and when she would be coming back. When she was on Christmas holidays with her father, they visited the paternal aunt in Brisbane, which was awkward because there were no female cousins, only boys, but she enjoyed going to the paternal grandparents on the Sunshine Coast.

32. In previous years, Chloe had been very shy and would go "mute" to the paternal grandparents, being too shy to speak, but she was much better now. The mother said, "I'd be a protector for her [when she was still with the father]". She said that Chloe could be quite submissive with Marc and that they had "different parenting skills".

33. I asked what the difference was between the mother's parenting skills and those of the father. The mother told me that the father believed in punishment and would send the children to the corner. She said he used to smack them but now he sent them to Time Out. He insisted that the children eat everything on their plate and that he was an adult and that they are children and he had to remain in control. She said: "It's about him, not about them."

34. The mother said: "He loves the kids very much. I don't want to diss his parenting style. He does have a huge care factor but a very controlling style."

35. I asked how the children had talked to her about contact with their father. She said they didn't really complain but there are a few issues, such as having to eat everything on their plate even though this might take two hours. He would make Chloe sit and eat until it was all gone. He makes them eat Jalapenos, anchovies and things that are "not to their palates". The mother told me that the father had Asperger's Syndrome and she knew that could explain some of his behaviour. ·She said they had a lot of fights about how to manage the children while they were still together.
 

36. The mother told me that she had taken Chloe for counselling and she was encouraged to ''use her voice" and if she is consistent as she gets older then has got to start listening to her.

37. On one occasion, Chloe had told the father that the movie they were watching together was too scary for her. I asked what was scary. She said it was called Snakes on a Plane and since then, she has told the father that she will leave the room rather than watch and become scared. The parents.have agreed that the children could watch M-rated movies but not MA-rated ones.

38. The mother told me, for example, that there were parts of Squid Game shown on the children's video game Roadblocks, which Marc had watched. The mother felt that this was beyond acceptable, given how many people were killed if they didn't succeed in the game. She told me that the Hunger Game·s was also rated M but that was somewhat better for the children than Squid Game.

39. She told me that she frequently fast forwarded through the fight scenes in movies.

40. I asked about the parents' communication and whether they are communicating mainly through solicitors. She said: ''Yes but sometimes [the father] drops over to the house to wash his car because he lives in ·a unit and can't do it there but will also walk through the house. He will bring up an issue such as putting restrictions on the children's computer and make that an excuse to walk through the house."

41. I asked the mother how she responded. She said: "I usually try and go outside and mow the lawns to avoid conflict in front of the children but he will bring up issues such as selling the house or custody and I will ask him to please hurry up and leave, that he shouldn't be in the house at all. She said: "He'll never get it. He will always come through."

42. I suggested changing the locks. She said: "I have changed the locks but the children went through the doggie door and he got the chilqren to let him in."

43. I asked about the separation and she told me that they when to counselling to see a psychologist, Jeroen Decates. He made the diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome on the father. The father came out and said: "I don't need counselling. She does." The mother believes that the father can't change and that he has obsessional needs such as to have the garden hose coiled right, to have the lid on the milk correct, the top of the olive jar screwed on correctly and he believed that the mother needed to change, not him.

44. The mother told me that the father had cameras put up in the back garden and, through that, fell out with the maternal aunt, Victoria. The father was apparently looking at the cameras on his computer at work and found the children playing with the hose in the back garden with no shoes on. He then rang the mother and said why are the children doing that and could she tell Victoria, who was babysitting them at the time, to make them put their shoes on. Her sister Victoria was mortified that "he had been watching" and believed that he was observing her breastfeeding the baby. She said it broke our friendship for five years. I did not have any contact with her. She said the father also thought Henry was a bad influence on Charlie but that he also had "issues with all my friends".
 

45. The father apparently had started a business called eJukeboxand that he would work on eJukebox during Sundays and when he was having a break from eJukebox he wanted the family to be around, which restricted what the mother and the children could do every Sunday. If the mother wanted to go for a walk she was told she was not allowed to leave the house. He said that she could go for a walk after the children went to bed at 7.30pm, so she used to do that ·in the evening, but then the father would want her to sit and watch a movie with him when it was convenient for him.

46. I asked if there were any particular incidents around the time that they separated. She said: "He ended it. He sat the children down and said, 'Your mother and I have an announcement. Our relationship is over."' She said in their final fight he wanted her to get up at 6.00am to cook him a hot breakfas-t and make fruit salad for him as she should every morning. She also had to get the children up and ready for school.

47. In order to cope, they went to see Jeroen and the mother said she would hide food from the father to help the children from being so traumatised about having to eat everything. She told me that a father had a stick next to his bed to threaten the children with because he parented by fear. He used to say "I'll take you down aisle six" which apparently was the bad aisle.

48. The mother felt that she lost her own voice in the marriage and that she had tried to keep the peace as much as possible but in so doing she wasn't helping Chloe. She said: "When I couldn't go for walks, I knew it was wrong and I started to fight back."

49. She said Jeroen helped with some strategies hut, looking back, she said: "I'm so happy we're no longer together. I don't think I would have had the guts to end it. He had an issue with my friends for stupid reasons. I was a protector for the children. Now it has gotten way better. He is owning his parenting and the children now have their own voices. He is very controlling. It's his way or the highway."

50. I asked if the Police were ever involved. She said: "Yes, many times. He would come to the house and I'd have to call the Police." If the father was supposed to drop the children back to the mother at 3.00pm and he had a meeting, he would drop th    off at  5.00pm or  communicate  to  her  that  "I_'ll  have another  night.  Your  mother  can wait."

51. I asked about the Orders. She said: "It has been great. It has been the best thing. There is a 3.00pm drop-off. He could have easily called earlier. Now he has a personal trainer but at his place they don't socialise. They had scooters there in the holidays but he didn't take them to the park for scootering once. He has got a demanding job. He doesn't ask them what they want to do. I'm  emotionally connected to them. With him, he has to work but he really loves them and he wouldn't hurt them. There is no domestic violence. He has got Asperger's Syndrome and is not emotionally connected. They have to do what they're told. The children find it hard to stand up to him and feel intimidated by him."

52. I asked what they might have to stand up to him about. She said: "Watching scary movies, [not] having to have some playtime outside at the park and not having to eat things they don't like."

53. I asked if she meant that his need to work was denying the children's needs. She agreed.  She said: "I am  at  the park  every  day from  3.00pm  'til 6.00pm.. I'm  very socially interactive and busy with sports. He has just gotten a personal trainer for himself."

54. Apparently, the father was involved in the school bullying program and the father was in disagreement with some of the items discussed. He said that he would tell his children to hit back if they were bullied. The mother told me that the father was bullied when he was a child or teen and said that they should fight back in those situations. "He would encourage a child to hit back and these attitudes were a pressure between us at the break-up. He told me he wanted me to leave. He said pack your bags. He said he'd stay in the home with the children. I stopped doing his washing and cooking. I stayed out in the evenings to avoid arguments. He came into my bedroom and said I'm paying you. Go and clean the kitchen. My mess is there. We had a huge fight. He grabbed my phone and smashed it. I knocked his monitor on the floor. I made a Police report but there was no AVO. After that he went overseas and my lawyer suggested I change the locks." The Police wanted to question him, she told me, and then he left the marital home. He was worried about an AVO.

55. "He kept thinking that I would call the Police. He could see on his video cameras the Police car coming to the house, so he didn't see the children for about four weeks. He went overseas and visited Queensland to see his family but didn't want to talk to the Police."

56. I asked about verbal violence. She said: "No, not really but there was always financial abuse. He is in a hurry to sell the·house. He put a hold on the mortgage at the beginning of COVID but then cancelled it, which brought up $10,000 dollars of · arrears which are yet to be paid. The Commonwealth Bank team are trying to sort out the mortgage."

57. The father had been telling the children that the mother won't be able to afford to buy a home in Sydney and would have to buy a place on the Central Coast, so the children would be spending more time with him. "He said he would take the children away from me because I will be out of area. He goes on about 50 per cent custody and the children don't want 50 per cent with Dad. They told him we don't want it."

58. I asked how they knew about these details. She said: "He always says it. He says I want you for 50 per cent of the time. The house would be sold. The dog will live with me. This really upsets Chloe." I asked the mother if she thought she could afford to keep the marital home. She said: "Yes." I asked if she was qualified as a real estate agent for sales. She said that she was but she was currently working in property management and reception and support for the sales team. She is involved with Saturday morning showings every week.

59. I asked her how she managed in the school holidays. She said that she takes one week of annual leave each school holidays and sends the children to tennis camp from 9.00am to 12.00pm some days but that the agency is closed for three weeks at Christmas.

60. I asked her about the family history of mental health problems. She told me that her father, the maternal grandfather, had Bipolar Disorder and died of cancer in 2004. Her mother died in 2010 of Motor Neurone Disease.

61. Her younger sister, Julia, passed away in March 2021, two days after being discharged from hospital in Adelaide. I believe that she suffered from Bipolar Disorder and that she might have been drinking alcohol prior to her death.

62. She lived between Sydney and Adelaide and she had been started on a new medication and died in her sleep. Julia had spoken to the mother on the phone not long before her death and sounded quite stable in her mental health. The mother was uncertain about the autopsy report which would apparently be sent to the GP. She told me that she and her older sister, Victoria, who is only 14 months older, were very close following separation.

63. I asked if she had a relationship with the paternal grandmother. She said it was reasonable and that she understood that Marc had Asperger's syndrome.

64. I asked what she believed the father's childhood was like. She said he was non-social and wanted to do radio or computers. He·excelled in this and he was excellent at work at Microsoft. He was not a social child and he was bullied at high school.

65. I asked if she had been told about his mental health. She said that his parents would come and stay every three months or so for about IO days and.would stay in the downstairs guest room. They were helpful, would clean, cook and wash, which gave the mother a break. "We'd enjoy dinner around the kitchen table and she believed it was a good thing for the family." I asked if the father's behaviour was different when his parents were there. She said no.

66. I asked her about her family of origin. She said her father was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when he was around 30 and was on Lithium and that her parents separated when the mother was six years of age. S.he said there was no domestic violence involved and that she hadn't experienced any traumatic incidents.

67. She told me that the maternal grandmother worked as a counsellor in Kings Cross and that they moved to Adelaide when she was 13 years of age. This was for financial reasons when the maternal grandmother could no longer afford the school fees for PLC, so she moved in Year 7 and went to Unley High School part of the way through Year 8 and stayed there through Year 12.

68. When the mother finished Year 12, she did a clerical traineeship in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in South Australia and combined it with a business college diploma.

69. When she was 21, she moved back to Sydney and lived with her father in Cremorne and did some nannying jobs prior to getting a job at the real estate agency, Professionals of Cremorne. She worked in reception and property management assistance for about two years between 1998 and 2000.

70. She then changed fields and went into IT and worked for five years at Dell Computers while she was having children and had two lots of maternity leave, 18 months with Charlie and two years with Chloe.

71. She found full-time work with two little children and a house to maintain very difficult so she looked for a part-time role.
 
72. She found a job at Century 21, her current position as reception and property management, where she had been for six years now. She said that the staff were like family to her, were extremely family friendly and the office was five minutes from the children's school and five minutes from home. She denied any forensic history, was healthy, takes no medication and had no drug or alcohol issues.

73. I asked whether she had been to any counselling herself. She said that she had the 60i certificate from Relationships Australia but has not seen any other mental health professionals.

74. I asked her about the children' s health and she said that Charlie had a sore back and some growing pains. Chloe had some stomach aches, possibly from anxiety but had been put on a lactose free diet.

75. When asked further about her developmental history, the mother said she was born in Tamworth but her parents had lived in Lindfield. Her father wanted to move to Tamworth to a farm that had been in the family. When they moved there the maternal grandmother hated it, feeling so isolated, and after six years she left the marriage with her three daughters and moved to St Ives. The father eventually followed, getting another home in Sydney and they would see him every Sunday from 10.00am to 3.00pm. He lived in Mosman.

76. The father re-partnered when the mother was aged 10 and her stepmother worked at the Country Road store at Mosman. Her name was Caroline. She did not play much part in the mother's upbringing.

77. When the family moved to Adelaide when the mother was 13, she stopped seeing the father until she turned 21 and moved back to Sydney.

78. I asked if there was animosity between the maternal grandparents. She said no. Her mother never put her father down and she really appreciated that, as she believed a child's relationship with their father was very important. She tried never to put the father  down in  front  of  the  children  and-  her  father  was  the  same.  I asked  if  the maternal grandfather visited Adelaide. She said: "Once or twice in the hospital but we never went to Sydney to see him."

79. I asked about her pregnancy with Charlie. She said it was not planned but they were over the moon that she was pregnant. She had an easy pregnancy and was able to work up until term. Charlie was born at The Mater Hospital by caesarean section for failure to progress. He was a healthy infant and breastfed for two years with normal milestones.

80. Chloe was somewhat planned. Again, the pregnancy was easy and after a trial of labour, Chloe was delivered by caesarean section with the cord around the neck. She was healthy and weighed 4kg. Chloe was breastfed for two years and had normal milestones.

81. The mother returned to work when Charlie was 18 months and Chloe was two years and she thought that day care was good for the children to learn social interactions.

82. She said that Chloe had a little bit of separation anxiety to start with but none when she started school at the age of five. The mother told me that Chloe would prefer to be home-schooledbut knew that, if she had no choice, she would go.

83. I asked the mother if she had anything else to tell me. She said that the school was "amazing" and that the child was so happy with her friendships and being part of that "beautiful community".

84. I asked about the possible high schools. She said they were in the catchment area of St Ives High_which has a gifted and talented stream and that both their cousins would probably go there as well.

85. She reiterated that they have a great lifestyle in Asquith, where she was able to send Charlie to the park by himself because there were no roads to cross and that many of their friends will go to St Ives High as well.

86. The mother asked me to speak with Rebecca, her school friend, who looked after the children every Saturday as well as her brother-in-law Andrew Kyngdon, who had a PhD in psychology. The mother also asked whether my report would be ready in two weeks for the Conciliation session, which I said would be impossible. I told her about the schedule for the following day involving the observation with the children.

87. On Day 2 of the assessment, I asked the mother if she wanted to tell me anything that she had forgotten to say. She told me that she and Chloe had been to a psychologist together twice and had been to counselling with the father but the counsellor declined continuation saying, "It wasn't really working."

88. I asked the mother how she thought the children would respond to equal time with the father. She said they wouldn't manage it at all. They would both struggle with 50/50. I asked what she meant by struggle. She said they would be more intimidated. They are quiet around him. They are res_tricted from being themselves. They would be more robotic. I asked if there was any other distressed behaviour that she had seen. She said: "They get clingy and want to sleep in my bed." I asked if they did .that every night. She said: "No. The two or three nights before contact and there is not enough room for me, the two kids and the dog." She said sometimes Charlie brought his mattress and put it next to her bed but Chloe was getting a double-bed mattress and she says that she will now sleep in her own- bed. The mother was also trying to renovate the children's rooms and allowing them to choose a colour or theme for the walls so that they would sleep alone in their own rooms.

89. I asked if the children had nightmares. She said: "No but Charlie needs a night light and gets scared if the dog barks at night. He doesn't sleep walk or have night terrors."

90. I asked if she thought Chloe was anxious. She said: "Chloe goes extremely quiet but now she is more out of her shell. She used to be silent with the paternal grandparents and wouldn't answer which they thought was rude and she would ' hide behind me'. She is getting better but she is still shy in class." I asked if the children had any contact from the paternal grandparents from her place. She said no but she that they see their (maternal) cousms daily and together: they were like four brothers and sisters.

91. I asked her what she would do if the matrimonial home had to be sold. She said: "I am in property management. I would have to rent a unit in Asquith." I asked what her goal was. She said: "To buy him out and stay in the house until they finish the HSC." I said: "Roughly eight years." She said yes. I asked if she would be able to get a mortgage. She said: "I've got a good mortgage broker and if we conciliate she will be ready to go and I will be approved." I asked what that depended on. She said that her wage plus the Child Support she gets from the father would be enough to pay' the mortgage. I asked why the father hadn't agreed. She said: "He thought the price I had offered him for the house was too little. I wasn't willing to give extra time and I am still not going to give him extra time. We probably won't be able to settle if he wants more. He says it to the kids that he will get 50/50, which sucks because before he only was asking for two days a week. Now he is fixated on 50/50 and it is hard to change his mindset."

92. I asked her what her sister and her had disagreed on for five years. She said: "Victoria thought he was spying on her. I was confident he wasn't looking through six cameras but she brought it up. He got angry that .the children had no shoes on and were playing with the hose so he rang me. She got in trouble on how she was looking after the children. They were going to take it to the Police. Andrew could explain .and Victoria felt violated. They could prove that he was looking through the camera and she was breastfeeding outside watching the children jumping. She felt violated. He said he was changing the batteries and it was a coincidence." I asked if the father was the type of person who would lie. She said, after thinking for a while, "I  don't know. I tried to believe in what he was saying:" I asked if she thought her sister was overplaying it. She said: ''Not overplaying it but I don't think he would have spied on her breastfeeding. He is controlling but he wouldn't have been looking purely for her breastfeeding. The children weren't allowed to play with the hose and they had no shoes on." I suggested that, if the father were "perving", he wouldn't ring up at the time. She agreed.

93. I asked how long it took for the children to transition to home when they arrived back from contact. She said: "A couple of hours. They are dropped off at 3.00pm and, by that night, they are happy in their own beds. They say they have missed me. Maybe five hours." I asked what she did before contact. She said that each child has a teddy bear which she sprays with her perfume and they both get 50 kisses. Her main concern, she said, was that he doesn't take them to the park and that he tells the children that they will have to move out of area and live on the Central Coast. Chloe asked her "Is that true, Mummy?" and her mother told her that was not going to be the case, nor would she lose custody if she moved.

94. The mother was very keen to keep the children in their current community and she said: "I am not agreeing to 50/50. Chloe even struggles on four nights and she asks for three a fortnight. It is a matter of her getting used to it."

### Observations of the mother:

96. The mother was a tall, blonde woman who was neatly attired. She was very articulate and gave the impression of being very reasonable and flexible. She seemed proud of the job she was doing for the children and how her career had been modified to optimise her mothering.

97. She seemed to understand the children's emotional needs and they responded to her with affection.

## The father:
Marc Kean - DOB: 06/06/76

99. The father in this case was a 46-year-old IT engineer and salesman who lives in rental accommodation in Chatswood. He has the children for contact four days a fortnight. I asked him in his own words what the case was about and he said it was about the financial settlement and the children.

100. I asked him what he does with them at contact. He said: "Keep them off the computer. Spend time with them." He said it was a balancing act to get them to do reading and not to have too much computer time; "It is no good for their brains." He said: "Work, rest and play. All things are okay in moderation. To cook, do jobs around the house, get them to help, bring their plates, rinse them, put them in the dishwasher, hang their clothes up after they take them off. They are well-trained. They have got their own bathroom. They know how to clean it and work as a team. They clean their bathroom and bedroom. When they come we will go out to dinner, hang out or drive up the coast. I take them out as.much as I can but not for the whole day. It's a balancing act."

101. I asked him what they were doing when they were on the computer. He said: "Good question. They have awesome computers with Windows 10 and will get the latest updates. They are on Roblox and they play with friends on Roblox. They played all lockdown. Kids can play. Charlie·and Chloe side by side. Loving it in their own world. It's a kids' game. Charlie will ring his friend on his phone, Oscar and Emma on hers and play while they are on speaker. Normally they are all happy. Sometimes I hear Chloe say 'Stop it' Charlie when he annoys her."

102. He told me that he has an App on his phone where he can cease their Wi fi. "I count backwards from 10. Then they come in and say, 'Dad, why did you tum our Internet off?' It's the magic button." He told me about a· survey he had heard of on the radio which found what people would least like to be stolen from them. He said that people would hold tight to their phone more than they would hang on to their wallets.

103. The father went on to say that all the devices are all on the Google Wi fi network, their phones, Nintendo, Xbox, computers and iPaa. "I can see them all. Google filters pornography and everything that's bad so I know there's nothing dodgy," he said. "I can see where their location is and Google will only allow them to have G-rated games and there is a strict policy that gets checked in the App store. It is the same for Disney Plus and Netflix."

104. The father took exception to the children using Rebecca's phone because it did not have the same filter for adult content He said: "I work at Microsoft. I don't have to worry. It can't be hacked. It's got an eight·digit PIN. Microsoft is the most targeted device on the planet."

105. I asked him what he was applying for regarding the contact time. He said: "More time, a lot more time. Week on, week off. My situation has changed. I have had a change of roles so that I have 'hybrid working conditions'. I can get parenting leave. The children come first. The company accepts that it is normal to pick up your children at 3.00pm, spend time with them from 3.00pm-5.00pm and then work after they have gone to bed at 7.30pm. You can do that at Microsoft. Not with the government. It is literally work when you want to. COVID changed it. It changed to hybrid. The other good thing is that I can manage my bookings if I have to travel interstate. I can plan ahead." I suggested it has given him greater flexibility to which he agreed.

106. I asked him what his new role was. He said he was a customer engineer and that he was working with top companies in the country to switch them to a public cloud called AZURE and helping them get the most value out of that cloud. He said: "It'd blow your mind."

107. I asked him what was required for his job.. He said: "Eight hours work a day is not required but just to work enough to get the job done. I work my arse off to get stuff done but there is no-one keeping track of the hours. There is no after hours. It could be all planned for week on, week off. I could be at work. I could do all my stuff. It'd work quite nicely."

108. I asked him what the children are doing besides playing on the computer. He said: "Sport. Charlie plays basketball. They run with me sometimes. Sometimes they will scooter for three or four kilometres with me. Other times they will wait in the. car while I finish my run. They play with their friends. Chloe does word searches and activity books. Charlie often loses patience with things. Chloe did a little bead thing and finished hers in two days. Charlie wanted one too. He has a habit of wanting the same as hers but then won't finish it. I am trying to teach him to finish things. He gets distracted. I am trying to teach him to focus on things. He read one whole book of Harry Potter's. They also like watching TV. I gradually steered the ship to multiple things to balance the time. There are some things you have got to do when you are older."

109. I asked him how successful he was at relating that. He said he told them "I don't like work. I have to put food on the table for you guys." By way of example, he told me that he recorded himself reading 720 time calls for a project. He said: "It killed me but it was good to finish it. Charlie listens. He gets things done. It is not an overnight fix. It is slowly changing. I can see it. He will come to me and say, 'What can I do?' I can see some changes in him and not to push it too much."

110. He went on to say: "I am probably a little bit more disciplined [than the mother]" and admitted that there were probably two different trains of thought. He said: "I follow to the letter." He was wanting to teach Charlie to follow through with things and·"be consistent".

111. I asked him what he did with the children if they were disobedient. He said: "They're not normally disobedient. A couple of things. I will ban the Internet or get them to stand in the corner. I don't know what happens at the other house. Probably my ex does it differently. They're out of routine because they are only here four days a fortnight. I will talk about whatever they have done. I say you've got to learn authority. It is respect to their elders. Alex probably said I used to smack them. I have cut back altogether. There was a lot of legal stuff about it. I don' t plan on doing it anymore. People don't like hearing that stuff."
 

112. I put to the father that their seemed to be a huge gap in their parenting styles. He said: "I can see when they come to me, they adjust. If it was week on, week off it would be more balanced in a way. I parent how I was parented. My mother would use the wooden spoon. She broke it on me although she would not admit it. It was funny. Or I'd get the belt. That didn't hurt as much. She'd  say wait  'til your father gets home and then he'd use the belt and that really, really hurt."

113. I suggested that things had changed in a generation. He said: ''Yes. Hey Hey .It's
Saturday has gone because of innuendo. The world has gone crazy."

114. I asked him what the children would have to do to be stood in the corner. He said: "If I am hearing an argument from the other room, Chloe would say 'Stop it Charlie'. I don't know who is at fault, so I put both of them in the corner so they can cool off. That stamped it out a bit. They're pretty good kids to be honest. I confiscated his phone for a day and then he picked it up and used it. I wasn't happy. I put him in the corner for longer than normal and then confiscated his phone for an extended day and a half. Generally speaking, the consistency and follow-through will stop them from crossing the line with me. They have been at the other place so there is adjustment time."

115. He went on to say that he was concerned about the mother working every second weekend and having Victoria, the maternal aunt, looking after the children. He said: "The family has a history of mental illness. Her other sister, I believe, suicide. She was a loose unit, a bad egg. We had issues. After two wines, she was out of control, drunk and slurring. She would smoke in front of the children and leave butts around. She would be up late at night and slam doors and walk mud into the room downstairs. It wasn't the upbringing to be around but, in Alexandra's mind, she could do no wrong. She would be in our backyard smoking. I wasn't the best of people with Alex. Both her parents died. Her little sister moved out at 13 and had no father. I saw her Julia two years ago at the pub, chain smoking and drunk and out of control. Four times she failed to hold down a job in Sydney and then she was dead. I had a gut feeling it would happen. The kids were saying she had a bottle of wine in the car with them."

116. "Victoria, the other sister, I have concerns about. Before the children were born, we had no problems. We were at a five-star hotel and Henry was running amok around the pool. I thought, 'Where's Andrew?' Victoria was chatting, oblivious to the noise. I had to intervene. I said, 'Henry, calm down. The adults are trying to relax.' Victoria paid no attention. The reason I am telling you this is that she looks after the children but was not really doing anything as a presence. The children do whatever they want."

117. The father said another thing happened approximately five years ago. He explained that the house at Asquith backs on to the bush and some tennis courts. He said that some bad people were breaking into houses in the area and the tennis courts had been broken into. He said: "It was my duty to protect the family. I bought security cameras at the time. They are not so good as the ones we have now. They were not High Definition or 4K. They were battery operated. They did not have solar ones. At that time, I put them in all the doorways and they detect movement and record 10 seconds which uploads to the cloud and sends me an alert. They have night vision and fish eye with wide angle lenses. At least, if we were broken into I could forward it to the Police. They came with stickers in the box and it is a good thing because the house was more safe. Victoria and Andrew said. 'We're not very comfortable with cameras.' I saw on the website that the battery level was getting low and while I was at work the thought popped into my head so I ordered batteries in bulk on eBay and when I looked, I noticed the children were in the backyard with no shoes. I was concerned about spiders, so I rang Alex and asked her to ring Victoria who was babysitting and ask her to please make sure the children had shoes on. Victoria asked. ' How did Marc know?' Victoria said, 'Oh my god, he spied on me breastfeeding·' and told Andrew, her husband, who said, 'You're a pervert. You spy on my wife while she is breastfeeding.' It would have been pixelated she was so far away. Alex was on my side and we never saw them for four years. We kept them out of our lives. They think I'm a perverted weirdo. Alex and I split up. She had no parents and needed help so she has turned to her sister now. Victoria and Andrew are heavily into our lives and regularly spend time with the children."

118. He went on to say: "Another story will make you laugh. Dad was visiting from Queensland. He was the CEO of the New Zealand Tourism Board for six years, the general manager for Queensland Tourism for 10 years and the CEO of Tropical North Queensland. He was big in tourism. He was having a conversation with Andrew who drives an Alpha Romeo. He asked him, 'Why drive an Alpha?' Andrew answered, 'A Japanese car I had gave me a sore back so now I only buy Italian cars.' He was sincere that his reason was a sore back. He could have put his back out by bending over but he was deadly serious. He is a doctor. A different type of doctor, mind you. On the surface a nice guy but he is a piece of work. He was telling me my job. He is spending a lot of time with the children but there are two completely different parenting styles."

119. "They could get away with a lot and be coerced into things. Charlie is an addictive person. I have worries about him." I suggested that Charlie was only 10. He said that he wanted more Nutella. He went out of hi1, way to eat bad stuff. Chloe is more laid back. If he gets older, drugs would be another influence like cigarettes, like bad food. Also, he is going to the park by himself after three o'clock to meet his friends there. Alex told me that he is supervised by other parents but he was alone when one other adult had to leave. What Alex says and what actually happens are two different things. If I asked her three times to get the answer, each time it could be different. Charlie got a new iPad. I hear Bec needed her iPad back and Izzy needed to use it. I saw that it was non-PIN protected. I signed into it as my account. I had sent instructions to Alex. She doesn't see the importance of it. The kids can get into.her phone. Chloe uses her mother's phone when she contacts me or through Alex's Facebook messenger. I asked her. 'Please change your PIN so they can' t access adult content.' Alex never sees the importance of this. The kids can get into her phone."

120. He went on to say another example was the new grass delivery in the months before separation. " I had seen it advertised on Gumtree and bought extra rolls. A person came around to buy the extra rolls and dealt with Alex.·When I returned, I asked Alex the question, 'Had he paid?' Alex said, 'It's in the office.' I said, ' Can we go and get it?' Alex said, 'It's not there yet.' It turns out he hadn't paid." The father said he called him and the customer returned, paid and took the extra grass away.

121. I asked if the father had difficulty trusting the mother. He said: "Every time I asked, I have learnt that I can't believe her." He said by way of example that the kitchen bench had a granite top with silicon sealant that was a bit cracked and allowing water leakage underneath. He said he thought "I've got to fix it so I got a roll of old silicon, cleaned it with metho, put tape on each side in a nice straight line, with blue tape like dog's balls and I said, 'Just letting you know it's still wet'. She said, 'OK, cool' and after dinner she was wiping the area. The silicon had broken in two places. It shouldn't happen. I asked what happened. She said: 'It wasn't me' but I know·she accidentally wiped it. I don't know what it is about her. I wasn't going to rouse on her but it irritated me more. She could have said, 'I don't know'. I ripped it up and did it all over again and let it dry overnight."

122. The father said that the mother's father had Bipolar Disorder and that the mother would not give a reason for the sister's death, even though there had been an autopsy. He was uncertain what that showed and that Victoria was not aware of the content of the autopsy. He said: "Alex is not coping. I will bring another thing up. Ginger, the beagle pup, was on the balcony. It is hard to keep her in but I needed to mow the lawn. I said, 'Please keep Ginger on the balcony·while I mow.' Alex said, 'Yep' but he came down through the doggie door and went out the gate. Apparently Chloe had asked Mum can I bring Ginger inside and he got out through the doggie door and pissed off. There's some mental issues there. It's a bit of a concern to be honest."

123. I asked what problems he thought the mother had with her mental health. He said: "All those things I've talked about. It's as if she's somewhere else and not in the present. Before kids, we were fine. After we had Charlie there was more pressure, sort of, on the house. I'm not easy to live with. I'm Asperger's. I'm like Elon Musk and Bill Gates. I'm a detail person. I like to understand to the nth degree. She knew I had Asperger's. She said, 'You are attacking me. Stop attacking me' and she'd go off. After Chloe was born, she spiraled out of control and we couldn't talk. There were no physical fights but things ended in arguments. What happened? I am trying to understand in my own way." The father told me that many times the mother would lose her temper and storm off, take off in the car or "scream off around the corner" while the children were crying. "I was asking questions," he said.

124. I asked if that led to the breakup. He said: "It gradually got worse and worse. There were times we'd watch TV after the kids were in bed. At those time, we could pause it and eat Tim Tams together but that dropped off. In the end, I'd be up late working in the office and at 9.30pm the children were asleep and she had already gone to bed without saying goodnight. The house was not locked up. The house was constantly unlocked. We back on to the bush and the tennis courts. People could break into the nearest house. She didn't believe we would be broken into. We went to see somebody [a counsellor]." Apparently Jeroen Decates suggested that they go on a date and organise to get a babysitter. After a drink, she brought up what happened previously and it ended up in us not getting on. It had gone too far to repair. I suggested we go to the ------' club that I'd seen on Sunrise on TV. I was ------ off myself not having sex because she was asleep before me and I would be up earlier. I said to Alex, 'Should we go to a ------' club?' We went to this place and it was different. I may have touched another woman. She didn't take too kindly to it. We left and went home on the train. Alex said, 'I can't believe you just did that."'

125. "Another time, I went to the Gold Coast. I went to a strip bar where there was no touching. What bloke doesn't go to a strip club? You can see boobs on TV·. she thought I was against her. I could not rely on her. She thought there was no point keeping the house locked. She couldn't organise to sell the grass.

126. He said: "It was the worst thing ever. We can't even talk and ended up in an argument. Her voice and mine would go up in decibels as it became more heated. There was no abuse. It was all above board. There was no verbal or physical abuse. She physically pushed me out of the kitchen onto a bookshelf which really hurt but she can get away with it. She's a woman."

127. "I spoke to a lawyer before I spoke to her. He said, 'Sleep in the spare room', which I did since 2 November 2019. The·next morning, I had told her I will stay downstairs. We couldn't even talk. I think she was shocked. Not surprised. She wasn't happy. The children were privy to bickering the whole time. There was no broken glass but a loud volume of talking. We weren't happy. She was prepared to accept that I was paying the bills. Neither of us were happy and it only lasted three months when things got out of control. I started paying Child Support and I asked for the credit card back because she was double dipping, I couldn't afford both. She arranged for the Police to show up and the Police said, 'Be careful. This could end up as domestic violence. 'We had snatched each other's phone so we separated. I paid 100 per cent of the mortgage and Child Support. She lived for free for three months. All I expect was for her to keep the kitchen clean. She didn't even do that. I went into the bedroom to tell her and she said, 'No, fuck off.' I got crazy. She grabbed and smashed my stand up monitor on the ground and my headphones. I lost it. I grabbed her phone and threw it on the ground and smashed it. The next day she went to the cop shop with a complaint. I was at work but I saw the Police arrive at the house through the monitor and the lawyer said that I should get out of there. I had to stay in a hotel. I was crying all night after what happened. I had one week of work in Brisbane and had to go overseas for two weeks. The NSW Police contacted me in the United States and wanted to discuss the incident' when I returned. Alex texted, 'You have given me permission to destroy something of yours.' I told them that there was no AVO. It was tit for tat."

128. He went on to say that he was healthy and taking no medications. There was no family history of mental illness and he had no forensic history. In fact, he had baseline clearance for the Department of Defence·.

### Developmental history:

130. The father was born in Rockhampton and lived there with his parents until he was 18 months old. His father then accepted a job in Adelaide where they lived for three years and then they moved to Brisbane where he went to primary and high schools. He told me that high school was half useless for him because he was short-sighted and couldn't read the blackboard which was missed by the optometrist. He said: "Life was a blur. It wasn't a good experience for me. I was bullied a lot." He said the bullying was worse in New Zealand where they moved to Wellington when he was in Years 8 to 10 and he was sent to a boarding school in Whanganui. He said: "They didn't know I had Asperger's. I was trying to fit in but it was a disaster." He said that he was allowed to go back to a State school in Wellington and live at home but he wanted to be a radio announcer and spent the whole time organising the school radio program. He said he rang all the record companies in Auckland and had them send CDs and did voice overs when he was only in Year 10. The school rang his father and said that he hadn't been attending class but was spending all day doing the radio.

131. The father said: "I was surprised they pulled me out."

132. He got a radio announcing job for the night shift and slowly was given daytime announcing jobs on an easy listening station.

133. When he was 17 or 18 the family moved back to Brisbane but he could not get into the radio industry there. He studied IT at TAFE and he has been working his way up through Microsoft since then. In 2001, he went to London and worked in IT there "but," he said, "I went down the wrong road." He was using ------ and ------ and had lost all his self-confidence. He returned from London, -------- -------- and ------.

134. He had an episode of pericarditis for which he was hospitalised and which was connected to his ------ use so stopped all ------ from that time.

135. He now has had a personal trainer for the past two years; can run seven kilometres non-stop; has lost weight; is eating the right food and does not drink  alcohol Mondays to Thursdays but has around two standard drinks on Fridays and the weekend days.

136. I asked him what was the maximum amount of alcohol and drugs he had used. He said at one stage he was kicked out of his sister's when he was a teenager having eaten a whole pizza and four litres of ice-cream. He denied ever being addicted but he did ------ a lot, particularly when he was in London. His parents had never ------ and when his father smelled ------ on him he knew he had to stop. I asked if he ever drank when the children were with him. He said: "Two glasses of wine, not out of control." I asked if the mother drank regularly, which he denied.

137. I asked if the pregnancy with Charlie was planned. He said: "Half yes, half no." They had wanted children and had unprotected sex so they weren't surprised. On his birthday, they had sexual intercourse when the mother was pregnant and very soon after, her waters broke and she was in labour.

138. I asked what his reaction to fatherhood was. He said he saw his own son lying on his legs looking at his face and he said to him, "You don't understand but a journey- has started. Life has begun."

139. I suggested that, according to the mother's Affidavit, the father had done very little to assist with the children when they were babies. He said: "She·gave up working full time and I was working full time. At night, I would play with them. On the weekends, I would cook, bath the babies and took them to the shops. I was the main wage earner. I used to take the kids to work with me at Microsoft. [Managing Director] Steve Worrall has spoken to my kids. I have got a photo."

140. I told him about the schedule for the assessment on the following day and he suggested bringing in Monopoly which I thought would be too long a game.

141. On the second day, he had a number of things that he wanted to tell me. He wanted me to find out how Julie had died and what the family mental health history was. He said: "I am concerned how run down the house is. It is a dog's breakfast. The carpet is all ripped on the stairs. There is crap on the kitchen all over the place. The first valuation photo shows the rooms. They're an embarrassment. A pigsty. They have to look after Victoria's cat because a tree fell on their house. I could smell cats' faeces and I told Alex but she said. 'Your head is too close to your arse.' The cat doesn't know the difference. The cat can go underneath the house. It stinks. It's horrible. And the dog is not looked after. They don't squeeze the scent glands. She is not coping at all. I am concerned of her mental state. Two weeks ago, we arranged a new fence. The neighbour paid half. He contacted me and asked to borrow my saw. I didn't want to lend it to him because you never get it back in the same state. He didn't know we'd separated. I suggested loppers to come and when they came two weeks ago, I went there to pick stuff up. They had no clue. They were oblivious. The house was unlocked. The dog was there. The side gates were open. Ginger could get out. I rang Alex. She said: 'Oh, I thought they'd postponed. I spoke to the neighbour and he had texted the message to   Alex. If I'd been there, if she would have told me, it wouldn't have been out of control. The dog would get out. It was a disaster. Something is going wrong in her mind. I asked, 'So, the loppers had no idea and the dog could get out. Those were your concerns?'" The father said Rolly, the neighbour, did not know where Alex was. "I let Rolly know so he could tell me when they came. They dropped branches and damaged the house. There is already a hole in the fence. It is already damaged in multiple places and the clothesline is bent. It is a mess trying to fix it up with the neighbour. The house is not looked after. I went around the edges at the back of the lawn. She has not done the edges. Behind the fence, there is stuff. The house needs to be maintained. The garage is a pigsty."

142. I asked how he thought that would affect the children. He said his parents would give them $15,000 to do renovations, to repaint, to fix the back stairs, to do the edges properly, get a new whipper snipper. "A lot of work needs to be done if it looks like a dump and we settle."

143. I asked the father if he thought the mother could afford to stay in that house. He said: "That's the other thing. She is using the children for financial gain. She is not coping and she needs time out from the children to get herself on her feet, to get help from Victoria. She needs time. She is getting $2,500 from me a month, relying on me. With me, I pay directly, not through her. I get to enjoy that there is more appreciation. I am in the dark. I have no clue what she spends it on. It is easy money for her, the Child Support." I asked him if there was anything else he had to tell me. "She hasn't let me know about all the medical things for the children. She should text message me about medical appointments. I haven't been told about Chloe' s psychologist. I should have known. She is not keeping me in the loop."

### Observations of the father:

145. The father was a very tall blonde man with a neat beard who sat forward in his seat to start with. He was very talkative and intense and I frequently needed to interrupt him in order to ask a question. He showed enormous attention to excessive detail and admitted to having Asperger's Syndrome "like Elon Musk and Bill Gates".

146. He seemed lack insight to the effects of his repeated questioning and lacked emotional understanding. He had a concrete interaction with the world in the way that he answered. His answer to the question I had asked about his reaction to fatherhood was entirely about what he did rather than how h felt.

## The children: Charlie Kean-DOB: 06/07/2011

148. Charlie was in Year 4 at Asquith Public School. He told me his teacher's name was Miss Taylor. He told me he enjoyed playing cricket and basketball and going to· the park every day. He said that he would meet Ted or Oscar or Jo-Jo there, who were children from his school but not necessarily in his class.

149. He told me his two favourite subjects at school were Maths and Sport, particularly cricket.

150. I asked how he found the COVID lockdown which caused five months of home schooling. He said that it was not so bad but he was looking forward to returning to face- to-face school.

151. When considering the worst aspects of people, I asked about Henry his cousin. The best thing about Henry, Charlie said, was "he smiles a lot, he understands me and we always have a good time talking with each other. We're very creative and find a lot of things to do."

152. The worst thing was "he always puts himself negatively, saying about himself that he's an idiot."

153. When considering the best things about his sister Chloe, Charlie told me: "She always is up for to play a game with me such as chess. The worst thing was she is very annoying. Ever since she was born or when she was one and I was three, she started being annoying. Then I'd  hit her but no-t hard." I asked him what she would have to do to be annoying. He said: "She wants me to hit her. She thinks it's fun. One time she hid my charger and used it herself."

154. I asked him what the best thing about his mother was. He said: "She always lets me go to the park and lets me go to bed at 9.30. I can play Roblox until 9.30."

155. I asked Charlie if he was tired the next day which he denied. I asked him what the worst thing about Mum was. He said, after a while, "I don't think there is one."

156. I asked what his mother would do to discipline him. "She would say I can't have access to my iPad. I wouldn't be allowed to  have her phone for three days and have to read a book." I said, "So she would remove your privileges." He said: "Yes, she would turn off the Wi fi. Dad would, not Mum. She bans my sugar privileges."

157. I asked what the best thing about his father was. "He lets me go on the computer all day. I play Roblox." I asked if he talks to friends at the same time and he said yes. Not knowing much about Roblox I asked him what the aim of the game was. He said: "There are millions of different games and you can get Robucks"  which is money that I understand can be used within the games to get advantage. "That is how Roblox makes money from people," he told me. ·

158. The worst thing about Dad is "he never lets us go to the park. Whenever we're having dinner and the phone is next to us, he won't let me answer or even say I'm  just having dinner. He turns off the Internet for us to have lunch or dinner. He does it. I don't know why. He said we need to find a balance. He makes us do stuff. I got this diamond art kit and he wouldn't let me stop. It took three days to finish." I asked if it was boring, and he agreed. I asked what discipline his father used. He said: "He put me in the corner for 10 or 15 minutes." I asked what he would have to do to be put in the corner. He said: "If Chloe annoyed me and she'd stay stop. He does understand that Chloe should get in trouble too and he bans computer for the rest of the day. He blocks me out of my social life if the Internet is off. I can't play except non-Internet games, do nothing or sleep."

159. I asked: "What about TV or books?" He said: ''No device at all. I do read a book. At Dad's, I finished Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets." I asked if he had seen the movie as well. He said yes, he had seen all the Harry Potter movies.

160. I asked him what he might put in a good dream- . He said: A new dog but also to get 100 million dollars and spend it on a lot of stuff like buy a huge mansion and put everyone I know in it, Mum, Dad and my sister, Victoria, Andrew, Tony. Friends could live with me in this big, big house. I'd buy everyone a PSS and Mum a new car because Aunty Vic just got a new car." I asked him what would be in his nightmare and he said: "My worst fear is, and I have had this dream, I wake up and I am still in a dream but there is a thudding outside the curtains. I would get out of bed and there would be a loud thudding. I would see this huge giant. I would go and get Mum and Ginger and Chloe and Dad if he is with us too, because there is a giant heading our way."

161. I asked him if he had bad dreams more with Mum or Dad and he said: "More with Mum."

162. I asked him if anyone had told him what to say at this interview and then he asked me if it was confidential which I told him it was not. I asked him if anyone had discussed with him what went on in Court and he said no.

163. I asked if either of his parents talked to him about Court issues. He said: "Dad does. He said when Mum sells the house then she won't afford to be able to buy in Asquith and will have to move away and see Dad more and only see Mum four days a week every three weeks."

### Observations of Charlie:

165. Charlie was a tall blonde boy who had a very straightforward style, made good eye contact, was warm and appropriate. He did not seem anxious or have any mood abnormality. He was obedient and considerate with both his parents.


## Chloe Kean- DOB: 03/07/2013

167. Chloe was interviewed alone. I asked her to put people in three houses. In Chloe's house, she put Mum and her cousin, Chelsea. In the house next door, she put Dad and her brother Charlie. She was somewhat hesitant about putting someone in the house far away and she wrote "Liam" in small letters.

168. In her good dream box, she put a carefully done drawing which she did taking her time, covering her work with her hand . and showing it to me somewhat self­ consciously when it was finished. It read: "My good dream is about me getting a dog and my dad allows me to get one." The picture showed herself with her father, both with big smiles, and a dog jumping up on the table.

169. In her bad dream box, her nightmare was "when I get a dog my father takes him away and I can't have a dog." There was a picture of .a pet store, someone coming out of the pet store carrying the dog then shouting no, looking terribly scared and her dad without a facial expression taking the dog.

170. When given three magical wishes, her first wish was that Chelsea, Henry, Mum and Charlie could all live together and "I could still get to see my dad". Her second wish was "for us to go in the snow and go skiing and build snowmans(sic)" and her third wish was "my dad not to be so strict".

171. I asked Chloe what Dad was strict about. She said: "We have to read books for a long time and do Diamond Art. If we do something by accident, he gets mad and we have to go in the corner. I asked how long for and she said, "A long time."

172. I asked what she would have to do to go in the corner. She said: "If we clean up after ourselves and we forgot something, he gets us in trouble. We could just pick it up."

173. I asked what else could get her sent to the corner. She said: "If I fight with Charlie, we both go to the corner and have to read books for the rest of the day." I asked if the father blocked her screen time. She said yes.

174. I asked who she would like to take to a· desert island resort. She said: "Chelsea, Charlie, Mum and Dad."

175. In a rocket ship to the moon with only two seats, she would take her mother.

176. When considering the best and worst aspects of people the best thing about Chelsea was "she always plays with me and I get to- see her a lot now. My dad used to not let us see her. The worst thing about Chelsea was when my friends are over, Chelsea is a bad sport and cries a lot. She is seven."

177. The best thing about Charlie was "nothing". I said was there anything she liked doing with her brother. "We like having each other's cQmpany at Dad's and Mum's house," she replied. So I asked what she did at the father's home and she said: "We read books and play games together and the worst thing about Charlie was he never has time for me at Mum's." I asked what Charlie did. She said he plays Roblox with his friends on call or plays with Henry. He is always going to the park." I asked if she also went to the park. She said: "Yes but he goes more." I asked if Henry went alone. She said: ''Yes. He meets his friends there."  I asked if they included her in games. She said: "Sometimes they do, sometimes tl).ey don't."

178. I asked Chloe for the best features of her mother. She said: "Let me see. She lets me see Henry and Chelsea a lot. She gives me a lot of company." I asked what they did together. She said: "We usually played games, go in bed and have tea." I asked what she did when Charlie was at the park. She said: "I play on my iPad." I asked when her mother gets home. She said she picks us up at 3 o' clock but then works from home until night time.

179. I asked what the worst aspect of her mother were. Chloe said: "She never wants to play with me."

180. When I asked her the best thing about Dad,.Chloe she thought for a moment and then said: "He is a bit of fun. When he is working, he doesn't spend a lot of time with us. The worst thing about her father was he is on meetings and calls. He is getting more busy doing another type of work instead of spending time with us." "What sort of work?" I asked. She replied: "He does eJukebox, Microsoft and saying the time and temperature on radio."

181. I asked about the father's discipline. She said: "He used to smack us before he split with Mum but now he puts us in the corner and sometimes he smacks us." I asked when the last time was. She said: "Charlie forgot to bring his bag."

182. I asked Chloe what the mother did for discipline. She said: "She doesn't really do anything. She tells us to say sorry if we hurt one·another. If we do something wrong she doesn't do anything." I asked if that was confusing. She nodded.

183. I asked if she had any worries or concerns and Chloe said no. She told me her teacher was Mrs Beard and that she was nice. She said she used to be a casual but now she is a permanent teacher.

184. I asked if Chloe was looking forward to the return to school and she said: "No, I like home schooling. I do the work faster and without the teacher to explain so slowly. I can stay in my pyjamas. In Zoom I get to do emojis and backgrounds and funny faces."

185. I asked if she was looking forward to seeing her friends. She said that she likes seeing them and told me that Katarina used to be her friend but now she is with Emma.

186. I asked her what sport she liked to play and she told me tennis and basketball. I asked her what else she likes and she told me: "More time with Mum."

187. I asked her if anyone had told her what to say to me at the interview. She said no.

### Observations of Chloe:

189. She was a dark haired girl who seemed tall for her age and who was very self­-conscious to start with and pretty quiet. She became more talkative as the time went by and seemed quite articulate for her age.

190. She was not backwards at coming forwards when she disagreed with her father about the rules of Uno or the other card game, both of which were taken very seriously. She was quick to whinge if Charlie did something that she didn't want or disagreed with.

## The paternal grandmother Jill Kean - DOB: 21/01/1950

192. The paternal grandmother was interviewed by telephone as she was in Queensland recovering from a hip operation.

193. I asked her in her own words what the case was about and she said that Marc and Alex were trying to come to an agreement on the property and the children. She said that it was an unfortunate situation when they don't agree and that the Court had to become involved. She said that she had spoken to the mother soon after separation and she had hoped that they would be able to avoid Court but, she said, "Marc feels entitled to whatever".

194. The paternal grandmother also told me that she believed that the mother was "quite bitter about how Marc had treated her". She said to me that she wanted to make it very clear that she was "very fond of Alex" but that "the two were incompatible". She believed that the father wasn't happy because the couple were fighting a lot. The mother was quite bitter that the situation. wasn't handled well by the father and that with Asperger's the father would look at things very clinically and "that's how it is".

195. I asked if she thought that, after a property agreement was made, they would be able to get on better and she said that the mother seemed to be happy with the current situation and doesn't want the children to go to the father 50 per cent of the time. She went on to say that the father was very strong and had concerns about how the children were being brought up because Alex was "very soft and didn't follow through" and the children did what they wanted.

196. She went on to discuss the mother's past situation with her older sister, Victoria, and a younger sister, Julia, who passed away possibly by suicide. She said Victoria was about 18 months older than Alex and, after their parents separated and divorced, Julia went to live with the older sisters when she was about 14.

197. The paternal grandmother told me that her husband, the mother and her got on very well but she got the impression that, when the mother was growing up, Alex's maternal grandmother was disciplining the girls and keeping control. I clarified so she had a strong maternal grandmother and a soft mother when Alex was a child. She agreed and said that he had only met Alex's mother once when she was ill with motor neurone disease about six months before she died. "She seemed a very nice woman who was interested in human rights and aboriginal affairs" the paternal grandmother said but wondered how the maternal ·grandmother could have allowed her granddaughter, Julia, to move out of home at 14.

198. She said: "Family is very important to us." She explained that, when Marc was a child, her husband had a very busy job and she spent a lot of time trying to understand Marc's issues. She said that Marc. now takes notice of how he was brought up and of what his sister does bringing up her children in parenting his own.

199. She told me that Asperger's people have difficulty in relationships, the father does not have a lot of friends and that's the way it goes. After he split with the mother, the paternal grandmother said, she would speak to the father every day because he needed someone to lean on.

200. She said that the father was concerned that, without his influence in their lives, they wouldn't be able to maintain discipline because they ignore their mother and would become more and more difficult.

201. She went on to say that the father told her that the marital home was "a mess" and that the mother's housekeeping was very casual and that the father was concerned that the children need guidance and strength in directing their health and education because "they're both fabulous kids and they're both gorgeous".

202. She went on to say that Chloe needs her mother because she is a girl but she also needs to stay on the straight and narrow. "I personally don't think the mother can cope without the help of the father. He's quite capable. He could have them 50/50. Why not? He lives close by."

203. I asked about the father's family of origin and she told me that she has a daughter, Toni, who is 16 months older. She said they were perfect little children but it hasn't been easy.

204. I asked if she felt it was hard parenting the father. She said it wasn't hard but more "challenging". They were born in Rockhampton and soon after they moved to Adelaide and when he started at Kindergarten he developed a "nervous blinking" (which I interpreted to mean a tic). With other children, he found it really hard. He was taken to doctors and someone wanted to treat him with Ritalin and she said there was no way I was going to do that so she took him to OTs, physios and a psychiatrist who thought he was depressed which she believed was ridiculous. She said: "You ask either of them. They had a very happy childhood."

205. She said: "I know Marc told you that I used the wooden spoon. I came from a happy home but I understand that I was physically abused. I was belted with the iron cord by my Dad and I used to smack with the wooden spoon. That's how I was brought up that way. Marc was a toad of a child and would.test you. Smacking wasn't going to work with Marc. I went to a guidance counsellor but never had a real understanding of why he couldn't get on with other children. He was quite introverted."

206. He was initially booked in for Brisbane Boys College but rather than put him into an academic environment they sent him to the regular high school but the teacher had no control, so in Year 8 he was home schooled prior to the family moving to Wellington New Zealand when his father was made head of New Zealand Tourism. At that time, he was sent to a private boarding school which she said was a "stupid decision" and "Marc copped a rough time as an Australian. He was bullied." The paternal grandfather spent much of his time overseas and at the end of the year, Marc wrote down all the things that had happened to him, that he was scared of the other boys and his father took him out of that school. When the family moved back to Brisbane he did Outwared Bound, an IT course and a radio college course.

207. In 2007, Marc married his first wife Amanda. The paternal grandmother commented: "We knew it wouldn't work out". She said Amanda was "a screwed up individual and been married before. She had an unusual family but he wanted to be married. Maybe Amanda married Marc for financial benefit. They were only 18 months or two years together and they tried to have children which -would have been terrible. She was totally different to Alex. Alex is a lovely girl."

208. Around that time, apparently, the paternal aunt, Toni, spoke to the paternal grandmother saying, "Mum, I think Marc has got Asperger's Syndrome. He misses cues, he is brilliant at IT and he is doing really well at Microsoft." The paternal grandmother told me: "I'll help him and defend and support him, no matter what. Asperger's wasn't well known then but my daughter is a teacher and she sees it all the time. We are really proud of him."
 
209. I asked what she and her husband thought of Alex when they first met her. She said they liked her and still do. "I tried to help her but she couldn't get a handle on Marc. He is so different. We liked her and are sorry that it happened. She had been in a long-term relationship and wanted to have children, so did Marc, so they tried quite soon but Alex couldn't work with Marc on things that were important to him. Things were not done. He did eJukebox on weekends uploading music and she would take the children to the park. He is a different person." I asked how he was different when he was at school. She said, not relaxed, walking stiffly and he was Australian in New Zealand.

210. I said: "He's very tall. Couldn't he just tell the other boys to go to hell?" She said: "I don't understand. I went to the master at school. They would tell him one thing but then the whole dining room would make chicken noises at him. I would go really often and bring him food. They would congregate around him and he couldn't stand up to them. We didn't realise what these kids had done to him [at the boarding school]. They physically intimidated him at sport and they made him go out early in the morning and play soccer when it was freezing."

211. I asked her if the father got on with his sister. She said: "They had their moments. Marc can be quite definite." She went on to say that, when he and Alex split, Toni didn't agree with what he was doing. "Marc doesn't think his sister is listening to him so they broke apart. They are not madly close. I don't really know why. He thought that Alex and him should have children and get married, partly to keep us happy. He wants us to be happy."

212. I asked if the father and his sister played together as children. She said: "Yes, they did. They had a normal, happy childhood. I don't know if there was  some competition between the two of them. Toni is a very capable teacher and very much liked. She is very strong with her boys and never fed them rubbish. Maybe there was jealousy there. She is prickly about him. Her sons are aged 20, 18 and 17."

213. The paternal grandmother said that they [Toni's family] lived north of Brisbane on a property and it had been difficult recently because she couldn't visit them from New South Wales due to the COVID lockdown.

214. She last saw the children at Christmas when Charlie and Marc came to visit. Chloe couldn't come because she had a broken arm. "They came in March 2021 for Easter, for a whole week."

215. More recently, Chloe has been "funny on the phone". The paternal grandmother said that she had done some sewing and sent down a couple of dresses, but Chloe wouldn't talk to her.

216. In November 2020, she felt desperate to go and see the children and was able to spend a week in New South Wales. She said: "We played games and cooked. The children were very fond of us and our little dog. I hope it will continue. We had a group hug when we left. Ian thought I was going crazy because I needed to spend time with them. She said Charlie would chat away but I don't know about Chloe."

217. I asked if she knew Victoria and Andrew and if she had any thoughts about them. .She said: ''Yes, I'm glad you brought it up that there had been an incident or issues between Victoria and her son. She accused Marc of perving at her. They weren't getting on."

218. On one occasion, when they were all at Westfield Hornsby, she noticed that Victoria and Henry were following Ian and Marc as they went into a cafe and then Victoria came in and sat down at a table next to them. "Alex was very embarrassed. Victoria is a bit strange. I don't know what's behind it."

219. She related another occasion, when "we were all at the park and Victoria suddenly appeared and wanted to take the children. I was in charge of the children. She just wanted to go around the oval a bit but Alex didn't let her. Alex was a bit like that, a bit scatterbrained. Julie may have been an alcoholic with Bipolar Disorder. She was a screwed-up individual. I feel very sorry for Alex. Some of her friends were really vicious."

220. I told the paternal grandmother that I had interviewed the mother's friend, Rebecca known as Bee. She said that she liked Bee: "Her parents had money and she was married but it fell apart. She has one daughter, Izzy, who is a nice kid."

221. I asked if she thought that the mother's friends were filling her head full of venom for the father. She said: "There's Mona around the corner and Tanya. Marc was talking about them. He has been made the baddie. In their marriage, Marc was dominant. They thought Alex was too easy going and went along with the situation. Little things happened. I encouraged her to do things for herself. Julia was very close to Bec and Christian, a gay man, a lovely bloke, was quite close to both of them. I can't say anything bad about her (Bec) but they made him [Marc] the enemy."

222. I asked whether she thought the Asperger's syndrome would impact on the father's parenting. She said: "I don't think so. He clearly knows what to do and  how important it is. The children have good table manners and the way they speak, playing Monopoly. He spends time with them. He has taken up fitness ·and encouraged Chloe and Charlie to go with him. I don't think it is in the children's best interests to be with the mother all the time. She has her soft side but he keeps an eye on what's important." "So," I said, "You support him in 50/50 time?" She replied: "Absolutely. I'll do anything to support hlm. I encouraged him with cooking and, once the border is open, they will be able to come up as often as they can. I don't know if he could get into another relationship but he should have the children. He adores them. While he was working he knew exactly what to do. He would bring then into line and she does need him around."

223. I asked if the father was talking about his future with the children or running the mother down to the children. She said: "( have never heard him do that. We have counselled him not to. Alex is doing it just as much. She said she believed Chloe.has been funny because she hears the mother's discussions with her friends but if Marc is, he shouldn't be."

224. I asked the paternal grandmother if she had anything else to tell me. She said: "His reasoning for ending the relationship was·the endless arguments. Ian and I never argued. Things weren't easy for them. Alex called the Police about some just rubbish. Marc wouldn't have laid a hand on her. He just wouldn't. It's unfortunate·. reasoning is because of the children.

225. She didn't believe that the father was "madly in love enough to marry" the mother but felt pressured to have a family of his own. ·"That' s the way he is. People with Asperger's try but find it difficult to understand other people's point of view or change their ways. I would love to see him have the children."

226. I asked how she thought the children would adjust to 50/50 contact. She said: "I don't think it is an issue. Chloe is a girl so she needs her mother." The father had told the paternal grandmother that Chloe was ignoring him for the first 24 hours of contact. "He will ask her to do something but he w(mld wait until she obeys. He is aware of it."

227. I asked if the paternal grandfather had retired and she said that he had retired from tourism but was currently working on landscaping on their two and a half acre property north of Brisbane.

### Observations of the paternal grandmother:

229. She seemed a very straightforward woman who was unemotional and gave a somewhat disorganised history but she had firm views that she expressed clearly. She was entirely in support of her son and confident that he was capable of parenting the children half the time. She also was sad that the parents' relationship had not lasted but felt that the father had much to offer the children in balancing the mother's "softness".

230. She was not particularly psychologically-minded and did not believe that the children would have any adjustment problem to a change in the contact arrangements even though Chloe has been recently more silent than usual. She did not interpret this as shyness, anxiety or any emotional disturbance. Similarly, she interpreted the father's bullying at school as the physical actions of the bullies rather than the emotional psychological sequelae of being rejected by your peer group.

## Rebecca Ann Illes - DOB: 14/10/1978:

232. Rebecca, known as Bec, looked after the children on Saturday mornings most weekends when the mother was at work, including her own daughter Isabelle, known as Izzy.

233. Bec told me that she met the mother at school and they became strong friends when working at Percy Woods Cremorne, a real estate agency, about 20 years ago.

234. Bec told me that she separated from her own partner about six months before the mother and father separated, although her own separation was "a completely different situation". She said her partner found another woman but they had a daughter together. She told me that she had "worked hard at sharing" and that he was a "good man". I asked how long she had seen the parents together. She said: "From the beginning. He is different from everyone else. Marc is difficult to deal with and functions in a different manner to what I do." She didn't try and coerce the mother out of the relationship with the father. "She could choose whoever she wants."

235. I asked what Bec thought of the father when she first met him. "A nice person but not my type. He is very technical and IT driven. He is a controlling person and I didn't value that." She said she was a little surprised that the mother chose Marc but they had something in common. She said she thought Alex was "very tolerant and very placid". She said: "I couldn't live with a very controlling person. It got worse. It got very, very bad with Marc. She lost her voice completely."

236. Bec said Alex was "a very good mum. It shook her, the separation, which I found surprising but it's a very good thing. He'd find a sponge in the sink not squeezed. Some of his things were exceptionally silly but not to him. The hose had to be wrapped properly, really minor things that were not done correctly, she wasn't doing things right. For Marc it was a really big deal. I didn't see Alex for a number of months. She couldn't leave the house because he wanted them there on Sundays so he could see them on a break between working on eJukebox. She'd love Mondays. It was freedom for her. Afterwards, she could see her friends. Victoria pointed fingers but Marc never had an issue with me. I made an effort with him. Victoria ostracised Marc from friends because he was very different."

237. I asked Bec about the time when the mother wasn't speaking to her sister, Victoria. She told me that Marc had installed cameras and he checked them while at work and found that the children had no shoes on while Victoria was breastfeeding in the garden. She went off in a fit and said he was looking at her breastfeeding. I don't believe he was looking at her breastfeeding. He was dictating to Victoria how to look after his children. Alex stood by Marc but we all need family."

238. I put it to Bec that Marc said the house looked like a mess. She said: ''No, we purchased lawnmowers together but nothing was ever perfect. She copes beautifully with a big house and takes a lot of pride in 1t. We were sugar soaping the walls but it was never to Marc's standard. I'm sure he'd have a list of ludicrous complaints and the house is key for the children so she can raise the children with Victoria and in that community. Charlie is growing up so much and needs his friends as boys do."

239. "So," I said, ''the house doesn't smell?" She said: "No, never. It may be messy but no, it's not dirty. It's not who she is."

240. I asked if she thought the children were suitably stimulated and she said: "Yes. Charlie loves Cubs but Marc wants to be across everything. They go to swimming twice a week. Chloe was doing Dance. She looks up to Izzy in everything. She is doing softball. Alex tries to give them a rounded childhood. Marc loves the children. Izzy's always into Saturday sport but Marc wouldn't take them to Saturday sport. They weren't ever in a team. Marc doesn't believe in team sports. Charlie needs that as he goes into the higher years. He is really, really good at basketball. It'd be brilliant." I asked if the mother had re-partnered and she said, ''No, neither have I. We do the Manly walk together and spend some time away. COVID has actually been a gift so that I have non-stop time with my daughter." Bec said she hadn't missed seeing men.

241. I asked about Julia's death and how the mother might have been affected. She said: "Alex would go with the flow. She had good support. I have been a good support. I was close to Julia as well as Alex. Alex gets on with it. She looks after the kids but she had lost her sister who was also close to Victoria. It's a big thing for the children to process.

242. I asked about the maternal aunt's mental health issues. She said: "Julia had her personal battle. If you had coffee with her you couldn't tell. She was a good aunty. At the end, she moved to Adelaide. The children will remember her as Aunty Julia. Both Marc and Julia had issues." I asked if Julia had any other issues. She said no.

243. I asked if she saw the children on return from contact with the father. She said: "Yes, numerous times. They would come straight to my place at Hornsby and it takes them 24 to 48 hours to thaw out after that. Chloe is withdrawn and she has told Alex a lot of things that I haven't heard first hand. Marc talks to her in a derogatory way. I never discuss my ex in front of the children. They shouldn't be involved in parenting. Charlie's attitude to his mother is different when he comes back. I love those kids. I have known them since they were babies." ·

244. I put to her that the mother was lax in her discipline and she said that Charlie had a flare of anger like Marc. "She will allow him to calm down but there are consequences with removal of privileges such as not going to the park." She said that Alex could be stricter. "I don't put up with crap. If they drop something, I will say 'Pick up that wrapper'. They have to treat me with respect. They could be messy and demanding but I tell them. Charlie has watched his father yell and scream and speak to Alexandra in a disrespectful way as if she is nothing. She is a really beautiful, soft emotional person. They play with fairy cards and they can be safe and vulnerable. We go away as families together. Charlie has got to be tougher than he is with his father."

245. I asked her if she had seen the father's discipline. She said: "Yes. In one instance, I couldn't believe Alex allowed it. We were at the Vivid light show and I'd hide in the apartment. Five-year-old Charlie said to the father, 'Hurry up Dad, let's get going.' Marc put him in the bedroom, saying ' You're staying home alone'. They drove around the block and came to pick him up. When he arrived he was red-faced and hysterical. They were late. I sat down with Marc and said, "This is unacceptable." The fear that child carried it could be for life. At the end, Marc was not wanting that to happen again. Alex sat in the car the whole time."

246. "Another time Charlie wee'd in the McDonalds play zone and Marc took him home and hosed him down. He does some very silly things. I wouldn't be as tolerant a mother as Alex. I don't believe you should sit by and take it. She didn't know which way to go."

247. "The problem with Marc is that people let him get away with it. There is always an excuse. I just don't agree with his parenting. For Marc, there is only one way of thinking, his way, and his parents are enabling him. He was force-feeding the children but no-one has ever stopped it. It's his way, not the right way."

248. I asked what contact hours that she would suggest to the Judge. She said: "Three nights a fortnight would be enough. One night out to dinner and one weekend."

249. Bec said that she asked the children how their father is. "He wants them but doesn't engage with them. The less time with him the better, especially for Chloe. She finds it difficult to be vulnerable with Marc."

250. I asked about how they should have holiday contact. She said: "Weekabout. It is not perfect. Chloe struggles, is clingy before she goes to him. I don't know but three weeks [in a row] is way too long."

251. I asked if there was anything else she wanted to tell me. She said: "Marc provides discipline but he uses fear. He loves the children wholeheartedly but he doesn't respect boundaries and controls everything. With him interacting, Chloe has not found her power. The children are better off for the majority of time with their mother. It is imperative they have a good relationship with Marc but the children would benefit with an outside person to speak to. I'm there for them. They're great kids but they should have someone outside the family. Chloe might not discuss things with Alex. I believe they're fearful of Marc."

252. I asked what sort of fearful behaviour she has seen. "At our house they get fearful that they are not going to be home in time to see Marc. Charlie says we need to go now [to please Dad]. Chloe didn't speak much at all. Now she's talkative. Charlie wants to avoid his father's displeasure."

### Observations of Bec:

254. Bec seemed like a straightforward woman who obviously cared about the mother.and the children and was helping the mother through the separation as an emotional support. She clearly disagreed with a lot of the father's parenting, particularly his attention to the details of housekeeping as a priority rather than the children's security or happiness.

## Observation of the mother and the children:

256. The mother had brought some games to play with the children during the assessment. She started unfolding a mat for the floor, go·t out a blindfold and Chloe started shaping some plasticine into poo-shaped piles. "We've got three," said the mother. "I need four," said Chloe. Charlie walked over to the toy box and then back to. the couch. "I'll go first," said Chloe. "Youngest first," reiterated the mother. "Okay Charlie." "Yep," he replied. Chloe put the COVID mask over her eyes and then the mother turned her around three times. "Okay ready, one, two, three," she said. She had to walk across the mat avoiding stepping into the plasticine poo. At the same time, Charlie was sneaking around moving·the plasticine so that she would step into it. Chloe stepped in two piles. "That's two," said the mother. "My go," said Charlie, taking off his shoes. Chloe grabbed half a bacon roll from the mother's bag and started eating it. The mother turned Charlie around four times and said, "There we go." He stepped smack bang into the middle of two piles of "poo". "That's two and two," said the mother. "I' ve got to be the deciding person. Where's the mould?" asked the mother. "Make some more piles nice and high." "Where's the mask?" asked Charlie. "Here Charlie," said the mother. "Who will spin me around?" she asked. Charlie spun her four times. "Okay, enough," she said, laughing. She walked across the mat. "I've done three, right?" They all laughed. "Yep," said Charlie. "Do you want to verse each other?" ''No, let's do the next game," they said.

257. Chloe was lying on the couch looking at .the mother and Charlie. Charlie packed away the game. "I'm not setting up," said Charlie. "I'll set it up," said the mother. Both the children waited on the couch. "Okay, both come down here please." They both yawned. Charlie was helping unpack the next game. "Charlie, give me mine back," whinged Chloe. Charlie, give it back. They both went to the other room to get their water bottles. "Okay, do you want a physical challenge to wake you up a bit?" asked the mother. "Chloe, there's the blue button." They were playing a game somewhat like Snakes and Ladders but had to roll a dice that had different colours. Chloe was sorting out the cards, facing towards the door. "Okay, do you want to give some to Charlie? Thank you, Chloe," said the mother. "Do you have my phone?" asked Charlie. "It's in the other room," said the mother. At that point, Charlie spilt the whole water bottle on to the carpet. The mother and I soaked it up with paper towels without fuss.

258. During the game, they had to take a physical challenge such as chuff around the room like a steam train or give another player a hug and I noted that, by 25 minutes, Chloe was much more relaxed and involved in the game. While they were playing there was a feeling of relaxation in the room. They played for a while and the mother noticed that Chloe was near the finish line of the game. She pulled a card for a physical challenge to bounce around the room like a kangaroo, which she did, but when she sat down her knee joint cracked. "I always get that," she said. Once Chloe had won, the mother asked, do you want to keep going even though you have won? The mother and Charlie continued to play. At one stage, Charlie said, "Do the knee crack again" which Chloe did. Chloe was watching. "Charlie, you were on blue. It's Mum's go." Charlie had to answer a question. "How old would you be on your next birthday.?" "10," he said. They both said "No." "I forgot my age. I'm turning 11." "You don't usually forget your age until you're 90," joked the mother. When Charlie beat the mother Chloe threw the soft dice to her. "I come last," the mother said. She blew a big kiss to each of the children. Charlie said, "You didn't do it properly." At that point, Chloe showed her mother a graze on her knee. "Did you bring any Band Aids? You should have brung a Band Aid," she said. "Do you want to pass the cards over?" asked the mother. Charlie lay on the floor. Chloe took her jumper off and then started sorting the cards out and the mother packed away in silence. ''Do you guys know how to play Hangman?" the mother asked. They then started playing Hangman to Chloe's rules. They guessed all the vowels. Charlie came and sat next to the mother and gave her a cuddle. He was not really watching or involved in the game of Hangman. They played another game of Hangman until the time was over and then the mother organised them to get their shoes on and pack her games away. I then took the mother out of the room and brought the father in. ·


## Observation of the father and the children:

260. The father was standing in the room. He started talking and joking with the children while they were sitting on the floor. "Did you bring the Monopoly?" ''No, that'd probably last too long." Charlie said, ''You always win". The father said, "Charlie, you've got blue lips. Aren't they feeding you enough?" "I was playing Hangman," said Charlie. The children sat on the couch, not moving. "What do you want to do?" asked the father. "Okay, Uno. Are you happy with that? I thought we could integrate it with marbles. Come and sit in a circle. I should have brought a picnic chair." "Why?" asked one of the children. "To sit on the ground. It's difficult for guys to sit on the floor." "No it isn't," said Chloe. "It's two more weeks before you start school," the father went on. Chloe said, "Do we have to get masks in the classroom?" "Ted's teacher got vaccinated," said Charlie. The father lay on the floor and dealt the cards. "Ooh yay!" said Chloe. "Your go, Chloe." "I got nothing," said Chloe, settling into playing with the father. The father called on each child to have their go, putting down a card. "Chloe. Charlie. Chloe. Charlie." "Did you take four?" the father asked. "Chloe return two." The father was controlling the games. "Chloe. Charlie. Chloe. Charlie. Change colour." The children played in silence. "Chloe, change colour to yellow," the father said. "That means shuffle. It means put down your cards back and shuffle," said Charlie. "Let me just check."

261. The father at that stage got the rules out of the packet and was reading the fine print. "Other cards change colour. Give us your cards back and deal them back." The father shuffled. "Okay, you're ready?" Chloe asked, "After this, who's taking us home?" "Me," said the father. Charlie said, "Mum said it was her 'til 3.00." "But I wanna: see Bee," whinged Chloe. "You saw her last night," said the father. The father started directing the game. "Chloe, Charlie." Charlie shouted "Uno!" "You can't do that," said the father. "Reverse.direction. Chloe. Alright Charlie, your go. Your go green." "I can't do anything," said Chloe. "Change .to yellow ." "Uno," said Charlie. "Go it's yellow,  Chloe. That's green Chloe." "You skipped  me," said Chloe. "Hey, don't show people your cards Charlie. Your go Chloe. Charlie pick up. I can't put this down. It's the only card I can play. Charlie's go." "Uno," said Charlie. "Well done, Charlie. Here's a marble. The aim is to get as many marbles as you can. Then  you can choose what we have for dinner tonight." Chloe said, "We know the gift voucher is for KFC. Last night we couldn't see Phil or get KFC." "You'll see him," said the father. Chloe asked, "Why do you see Phil three times a week? Why not two times a week? You always go on runs." "Exercise is good for you, Chloe," said the father. "Everything in moderation. Hey, you're not going first. The person left of the dealer goes first. Your go, Charlie. Hold your cards to your chest. Breast your cards so no­ one can see. Go Chloe. Go Chloe. My go. Charlie. Chloe." Chloe said, ''You can't do that."

262. Chloe disputed the rules and picked up the rules and read from them about Wild Cards. "Where's how to play?" she asked. "It'll be under ending the game Chloe," said the father. "It doesn't say." "Ask Siri," said Charlie. "Give us a look said the father. He read the rule sheet.  'When next to last card, you must yell Uno. The winner is the first to go out. Nothing says that you can't use a Wild Card to end." Chloe said, "In Emma's rules it says that." "Are you sure?" asked the father. "This one's probably slightly different. Good luck folding it up again," he said, folding up the rules. The children looked bored.

263. "Can we play Sleeping Queens?" asked Chloe. "Do you want to play Sleeping Queens?" Charlie asked the father. "Fine," said Charlie. "Yes," said Chloe. The children were lying on the floor or the couch. "I .think Emma has got different rules. She made them up," said Chloe. The father asked to use my side table as he was getting a sore back leaning on to the floor. "Charlie come up here (onto the couch)." All three were sitting on the couch. "You're so big Dad. It's better on the floor." '·'It' s okay for you," said the father. Chloe had asked the father if he brought any Band Aids. The father asked, "What for?" "My knee," she said. "I'll sort it out when we get home," said the father. "Aren't we going to your place when this finishes?" asked Charlie. "I want to see Bee," said Chloe. 'I'll discuss it with your mother," said the father. "How are we supposed to play here?" said Chloe, "All three sitting on a two seater couch?" "Use this cushion to keep it flat," said the father. Chloe laid out 12 cards on the cushion. "Deal them out," Chloe said the father. "Do I need to shuffle them first?" "No," answered Chloe. Charlie had his head down." Are you tired?" asked the father. "What time did you go to bed? Where did you sleep?" "In my bed," said Charlie. "Good. How are we playing it? Shall I look at the instructions?" Chloe said there was something about a wand which they disagreed on. "I'm right," said Chloe. "Okay but last time.. .I'm right!" said Chloe almost shouting. "Okay," said the father. "How to set up?" He got out the rules. "The player to the left of the dealer goes first, then clockwise. Play a king to awaken the Sleeping Queen from the play area down the bottom. Apparently you can stop with the dragon." "I told you but you didn't believe me," said Chloe. "I did," said the father. "I know how to do the jester," said Chloe. "Calm down," said the father. ·

264. The father read out the rules from the Internet on his phone. "Jester says you take a card," said Chloe. "Are you ready?" asked the father. "I play a jester so I pick up. That's it. I picked up six. Listen t·o me," said Chloe. "You got to count the number. I've got to count six," said the father. "Now you've got a queen." said Chloe. The father read the rules again. "Here's your card ba:ck. Put it there," said Chloe. "Your go," Charlie. "Play a card first, then pick up a card," said the father. The father said, "I can pick up a Sleeping Queen." Chloe said, "Starfish only, worth five." "What do we do with the number cards?" asked the father. "Your go, Charlie." "How much cards do you s'posed to have?" asked Charlie. "I've got your queen Dad, but a dragon stops it." "I've got a dragon," said the father. "I was trying to read this [the rules]. It's your fault. Stop for a second, Chloe. It's too late.·It's in my pile. I don't know how to play. Hey, hang on, wait." He reads the instructions again. "I have a dragon," said Charlie. ''You need it to stop the sleeping potion," said Chloe. "My go," said the father. "How many queens do we need to get us, Charlie?" The father ignored· this and picked up and said, "Damn!" Charlie picked up. "Pick up, Chloe," said the father. "Okay, my go. It's my go," said the father. "Which one counts cards? Charlie, your go. Breast your cards." "I wanna put this down," and Charlie took one. Chloe said, "It's my go. Three and two makes five."

265. "What if you get most of the marbles?" asked Charlie. "Then I get to choose what's for dinner," said the father. "Did you get something special? It's my birthday." "What are you doing down there?" the father said to Chloe. Chloe said, "Four and seven is 11 and played a poodle." "I've got to grab a queen," said the father. "Charlie, stop." said Chloe. "Chloe, you've got to pick up," said Charlie. "I could see yours. She has it." "Don't  Charlie," said the father. Chloe. said· , "Emma's a cheat. She put it under herself." ''You've got to follow the rules," said the father. "Is that all you've got, Charlie? Go Chloe. Hey, it's my birthday. My go. We're going clockwise. Which way, Charlie? Hey, Charlie that's cheating," said the father. "Charlie, your go," said the father. "Two nines," said Charlie. "Wait on, you can't do that," said the father. ''Yes, you can," said both children. "Okay, fine. Chloe, go go go." Chloe whinged, "Charlie, you're trying to look at my cards, cheater." Both children were red faced and tired but they were both playing alo·ng. Chloe said, "Charlie, you're trying to look at my cards. I hate you." "Dragon," said Charlie. The father said, "Wand stops you. Okay, my go. Two and three makes five." He picked up five cards. "Dad, you have the cat queen," said Chloe. "Yes, I do," said the father. "Go Charlie. Go Charlie. Chloe go. You've got to play a card." "What's Dad doing with the dragon?" asked Chloe. "Dragon stops knight."

266. By 50 minutes, they were all very involved with the game. "I have 20," said Charlie. "Dang, I have 20, too," said Chloe. "Charlie, your go," said the father. "When do we stop? When all the queens are taken? I don't want it to stop," said Chloe and started singing "Down, down" and bouncing on the couch. "Are you ready for this?" asked the father. "Four and three and one makes eight. Go Charlie." ''Nine," said Charlie. "Jester," said Chloe. "I've got a king." The father said "It says you're cheating. You can put it in the pile."
 

267. The father went to the rules again. "Add it to your hand. You don' t have to use it," said the father. "How do you get the moon queen? Are you cheating?" asked Chloe. "What?" asked Charlie. "There's quite a few queens. I've got six. Let me shuffle," said the father. "Can we end it here? I'm bored," said Charlie. "Same - and hot," said Chloe. "Can you separate the green from the others please?" Charlie yawned. " Let me check," said the father. "Dad gets to pick what we have for dinner," said Charlie. "How many marbles?" asked Chloe. "That's unfair. What are we having for dinner?" "You will be absolutely over the moon," said the father. Chloe moved to the floor and the marble fell into Charlie's shirt pocket. ' 'Your.shorts are ready at Target," said the father. "Target takes so long," said Chloe and then they were out of time.

### Logic Lounge Psychology, Hornsby:

The documents produced under subpoena by Logic Lounge Psychology showed the Mental Health Care Plan and referral letter from the GP, Dr Rahman, but only brief notes from one appointment on 6 April 2021 with Ms Leslie Spitz. The notes seem to uphold the mother's evidence that the father was watching movies which suited him but seemed to scare Chloe; that he would insist on her eating everything on her plate, no matter how long it took, and that he forced them to eat Jalapenos when they didn't like them and gave them oversized portions inappropriate for their age.

It is unclear from the notes whether the mother was giving history or Chloe was giving history on her own.

## Opinion and Issues for Determination by Single Expert:

### The nature of the relationship between the children and each parent and any other relevant persons (including any gra dparent, new partner or other relative of the children):

#### The mother and the children

The children have always lived with the mother since infancy. She took maternity leave in order to stay at home during their first years of life. She breastfed them each for some months.

The mother has modified her work life to be available to drop off and pick them up from school, arrange their extracurricular activities both before and since separation.

The  children  were very  relaxed  and  seemed  calm·  in  her  presence and  she was clearly their primary attachment figure. They played together with giggles and smiles and Charlie was able to play a trick on Chloe while she was blindfolded. This showed his sense of security in being able to be himself and show his sense of humour.

#### The father and the children

The father had lived with the children from their birth until separation and had two nights a week contact with them regularly since interim orders were arranged. He also had them for seven nights in each holiday, allowing him to visit with them his parents and sister in Queensland.

The father can work flexibly from home and during the COVID 19 lockdown, was working entirely at home. When the children visit, he seems to spend time working either for Microsoft, eJukebox or recording voice overs. While he works, the children are expected to amuse themselves mostly playing computer games. If they annoy each other, he stops their Wi-Fi. The children complained that he rarely takes them to the park·and he commented it was hard to get them to go outside.

He did not apparently take the children to their Saturday morning sport on contact weekends, so they could not consistently participate in team sporting activities.

He had very firm views about how·they should behave and how they should complete their chores to his own standards of cleanliness. He was strict about rules and seemed unwavering in enforcing them, with punishments such as standing in the corner, losing screen time, completing an activity to the end even if it takes three days or eating everything on their plate even if it takes two hours. ·

At my assessment the father appropriately brought some card games to play with Charlie and Chloe. He engaged them in conversation initially standing and asking questions, while they were seated. He organised for them to play Uno but within minutes he had
questioned the manner of dealing and produced the fine print of the rules sheet and was quoting it to the children.

I presume he was showing me how fair he was in helping the children to follow the rules but it did seem finicky to argue this point with an eight year old about who goes first in the game.

The children did not seem surprised and went along with him and his winning Uno. They proceeded to play another game with various picture cards. Again, he disagreed with Chloe's rendition of the rules of play. He produced the rules online and read them out. Charlie sat quietly while Chloe argued and said she told him so when she turned out to be correct. This certainly prolonged the games and changed the tone from fun to serious instead of light-hearted. I had never previously seen a father respond in such a rule-bound way.

The children's interactions with him were respectful, tolerated rather than enjoyed. They said goodbye and gave him a kiss but the atmosphere in the room was tense. My impression was that the children's attachment with him was insecure and avoidant.

### The benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with each of the children's parents:

The mother is the children's main attachment  figure and source of security and while they are children they will need to spend a large proportion of their time with·her growing up, especially Chloe.

Whilst the father admitted to having Asperger's syndrome (now called Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1 according to the DSM-5) his view of the world is somewhat different to neurodevelopmentally average individuals. He has opinions about child rearing, the way he was brought up,as correct, his views on home maintenance being correct and his inflexibility make the possibility of change or negotiating virtually impossible.

Most probably, he believes other people are lax, messy and lazy and he implied this about the mother's housekeeping, allowing the children to get away with poor behaviour such as not finishing projects or tasks. In so doing (such as when he insisted Charlie complete a craft game of beads over three days even though he was sick of it) the father runs the risk of alienating the children. He already has failed to make his time a rich one for the children with child centred experiences.

The children will muck up and whinge and irritate·each other to get his attention, for which he provided punishment rather than picking up the cue that they needed to go outside  and  do  physical  activity  together.  He  does  not  realise  that  they  still  nee. d his attention with his participation in games.

Encouragement to read a book is a good thing but when it comes as a by-product of no screen time punishment, there comes a negative association with reading.

While the children are at an age where they go along with him, the contact days have been tolerated with some anticipatory anxiety prior and a transition period for some hours afterwards.

When they go into adolescence they are likely to challenge the father's views, refuse to comply with his demands and then later refuse to attend contact.

I do not believe the mother has alienated the children from the father but the father has failed to provide what they need at his home. All children need consistent boundaries but the rules at his house were arduous and do not allow them to relax. The evidence of school reports and the clinical psychologist, Dr Decates, showed nothing that could be construed as denigration of the father by the children or their mother.

In the future when one of the children refuses to comply, the father is likely to become angry and lose his temper, shouting at them and punishing them further. His lack of flexibility with the mother, which has led to frequent arguments, is likely to be the outcome for the children with this father.

He has a strong work ethic and is judiciously fair and a capable handyman, very neat and has things which the children would benefit from learning. However, his punctilious adherence to the rules and his using of rules to argue a point at this age, if copied, would make the children social pariahs.

### Each. parent's. understanding. of   the   children's. physical, developmental, psychological, emotional and intellectual needs:

#### The father

The father is aware of the physical needs of food, shelter and exercise that the children require but his insistence on them finishing everything on the plate irrespective of how long it takes, is a mistake. It could contribute to a cWld's anxiety at mealtime, and lead to an eating disorder or a misunderstanding of the child's psychological and emotional needs and changing their dietary requirements with age.

His reliance on the paternal grandmother to assist him with parenting advice may be misplaced, given that she raised him largely with punishment and denied that it would be an issue if the children were changed from two days to seven days a fortnight. The paternal grandmother did not appear to be psychologically minded to me and have insight into the children' s emotional lives. The father clashed with his sister over the way he was managing the separation. Presumably they had disagreed over parenting.

People with Asperger' s syndrome are poor at picking up social cues and often cannot understand other people's emotional states. It is important that parents know how their children are feeling to provide comfort, security and reassurance if required. Secure children have more resilience in the future in the face of later trauma.

Children's needs change with age and the father's persistent disregard of their need for age appropriate activity is unthinking and unhelpful. For example, taking them on a seven kilometre run. He needs the seven kilometre run but they do not and it is too long for an eight year old girl. He expected them to wait in the car for him. Whilst modelling regular exercise is to be applauded he can do a seven kilometre run on the five days a week that he does not have the children in contact. An adjustment needs to be made for their age and stage.

Teenagers frequenlty have machinations with their friends and their friendship groups (as the father experienced himself when young). He was unable to sort out his own problems and ended up leaving school early. He is ill equipped to assist his children through the normal problems of interpersonal relationships which will inevitably arise.
 

#### The mother

The children appear to be well-adjusted normal kids. This is mainly due to the mother's input. They do not have interpersonal problems with friends at school or with their cousins currently.

The mother has a good understanding of their physical needs, takes them frequently to the park, encourages them to play sports and is engaging them with the extended family. This has made them well-rounded delightful children.

She is aware of their shortcomings and educational needs as individuals and treats them differently due to their gender, age and stage (she has tea in bed with Chloe and Charlie is allowed to go the skate park alone and go to cubs).

She understands that Chloe finds it boring at the paternal aunt's in Brisbane given that there is a lack of small girls her age but she loves her maternal cousin, Chelsea. Despite the lack of maternal grandparents, the mother has found support from her sister and friend, Bee, and from her extended family where she gets emotional support for herself and the children.

It is concerning that the mother may not be able to afford to remain within close, convenient distance of the children's school and her work. She has an apparent plan to rent in Asquith if she is unable to keep the family home.

### Each   parent's. capacity. to   meet   the   children's. physical,. developmental, psychological, emotional and intellectual needs:

(i). The mother

The mother has devoted herself to raising the children and to co-parent with the father.
She struggled to find common ground with hi·s rigid parenting style which was
diametrically opposed to her laissez-faire parenting. She tried to tolerate it while they were together but it really seemed to grate with her to see Chloe forced to remain at the table for a long time. She has been seeing a psychologist and has been advocating for the children more recently. While she knows the children love their father and he loves them wholeheartedly, the mother is aware that they get anxious before going to contact and sleep in her bed. She understands that they would· prefer to remain with her but she encourages them to attend contact visits because she believes they need a relationship with their father.

Alone, the mother would be unable to support the children financially in their current lifestyle. She may be forced to rent accommodation to remain in Asquith. The mother has provided for the children's age-appropriate needs for physical activity, extended family and encouragement to complete homework. The children's school attendance has been good, Chloe's reports were glowing and, if they occasionally got into trouble, the school dealt with the problem immediately.

Financial constraints may reduce the mother' s choice of extracurricular activities for the children who are both sporty, want to be part of a basketball team and Chloe to play tennis.
 

(ii). The father

I understand the father has been paying Child Support since soon after separation.

Delays in financial settlement have meant that the family are uncertain as to where they may end up living. It would be in the interests of the children for them to be able to remain in their current geographical area for stability of schooling and support network.

The father understands the value of education but didn't flourish at school himself. He encourages the children to read and do their homework but at arm's length. While he models application to work and completion of tasks, he doesn't seem to understand that young children often need a parent to sit down with them and help them get started on a piece of work.

The father's difficulty in understanding the age-appropriate needs of his children greatly impairs his interpersonal relationships and interactions. He can give orders and expects employees to comply, but this doesn't work well for children in the 21st century. Normal children will question and bargain and negotiate which the father finds intolerable. He expects an unquestioning compliance and that his mode of parenting is the correct way as if his mother wrote the rules to be followed precisely.

Children vary with age and stage of development and this requires flexibility in parenting, a quality the father tends to lack. The inflexibility which is due to his neurodevelopmental disorder is a major deficit to his ability to relate to all people and in particular to his own children and previously, his wife.

### The attitude to the children and to the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by the children's parents:

(i). The mother

Largely through the mother's efforts, the children were relatively well adjusted kids. Their school reports indicated normal interpersonal relations. The mother was sensitive to their needs, had altered her career appropriately to parent them and saw them as individuals. She seemed to realise that her own support network of friends and family had a beneficial effect on the children.


(ii). The father

The father seemed to believe that he was deserving of half the children's time as his right and that the mother was being selfish in not agreeing to 50/50, in order to establish a more generous property settlement. This presumes that the children are objects like bargaining chips, not individuals with choices, likes and dislikes.

When the children were with him, he seemed to complete his own needs in preference to the children's, leaving them feeling unimportant and sidelined.

### Any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as maturity and level of understanding) that may affect the weight to be accorded to those views:
 

Both children put their father in the house next door to their own house in the drawing and themselves with their mother. Charlie included Chloe and the dog in his home. Chloe put Charlie next door with the father and Chelsea, her cousin. This illustrates that both children want to see their father. Neither of the children had a mature understanding of the decisions being made about their future. Charlie was not particularly mature for his age but appeared at least average in intelligence. Chloe seemed bri_ghtbut was only eight and two months at the time of the assessment and quite attached to the mother and possibly too knowledgeable about the court proceedings.

### The extent to which each of the parents has taken, or failed to take the opportunity to:

#### participate in making decisions about major long term issues in relation to the children; and

Each parent was making decisions about the children while the children were in their care. Whilst the parents are only communicating through solicitors it was not surprising that some information was not changing hands, such as the father was unaware that Chloe had been to see a psychologist.

The father's tendency to want to control details of the children' s lives has meant co­ parenting with him has been extremely difficult for the mother. This difficulty probably underlies the parents' inability to get on.

#### spend time with the children; and

Both parents love the children and want to spend as much time as possible with them. The father has now requested 50/50 time which.the mother has continued to refuse.

#### communicate with the children: ·

The children have spent more time with the mother throughout their lives and she communicates well with them. The father' s nature having less emotional understanding and his own concrete beliefs about what they need, has meant he has cut himself off from them psychologically. This is unintentional, however. The children feel his lack of understanding and his refusal to listen or negotiate with them:

### The extent to which each of the children's parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil the parents' obligations to maintain the children:

Both parents have tried to fulfil their role as parents in maintaining the children. The father has regularly paid child support since the first three months after separation. The mother has also worked to support them and provided a rich and stimulating environment for them.

i). The likely effect of any changes in the children's circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of the parents or any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the children) with whom the children have been living:

If the court were to make Orders for weekabout contact, the children would be upset initially and would eventually adjust to the extended stay with the father. They would not
 

be happy about it as they would see less of their own friends and less of their main security figure (the mother) which would caus.e them to become angry with the father and refuse to attend or possibly behave badly (Charlie). Chloe is probably more of an internaliser and would become more anxious missing her mother and her cousin, Chelsea.

I am concerned that the father would not support the mother's enrolling the children on Saturday morning sport such as tennis or cricket. He has a history of working at home on weekends and prioritising his own exercise regime over the children's needs to play and interact with him and their friends.

### The current and future capacity of the parents to communicate with each other to resolve parenting difficulties that might aris.e:

The parents are currently only communicating via solicitors' letters. Their history is one of being unable to resolve parenting issues since Charlie was an infant. There is no expectation that this would improve in the future, although sometimes after a financial settlement is achieved communication does improve.

### The maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of the children's parents and any other characteristics of the children that the Single Expert thinks are relevant:

The children are of Anglo-Australianextraction with no religious or cultural issues. The main disagreement has been over general parenting issues between the parents.

Charlie is a confident young man who is easy·  going and emotionally  aware. He is very interested in sports and his understanding is appropriate to his age.

Chloe is a bright girl who is close to her mother and they spend a lot of time together appropriately. She is articulate and more rule-bound than her brother.

Both children expressed a wish to live near their father and to continue to spend time with him. The time they spend with him is somewhat frustrating for them as they are often restricted to certain activities of his choice and not of their own or to wait until he has finished his work or his run before they can do their own activities. This may lead Charlie, and later Chloe, to refuse to attend contact with him when they enter adolescence. They may insist on doing their own activities at this time. Whilst they are still in primary school they are likely to be compliant but I expect that would change in the future unless the father becomes somewhat more flexible with them.

### The desirability and likely effect of each parent's proposal as to the parent with whom the children lives with and the parent with whom the children spends time with:

The mother's proposal is that the children remain at four days per fortnight or three days
per fortnight and one dinner in the alternate week. The father's proposal is  for week about 50/50.

As stated above, I think the children would adjust to 50/50 but would be unhappy about it and  eventually  refuse to  attend.  The childre_n seem·  very happy  and  well-adjusted  with four nights a fortnight although as they get into high school they may do better with three nights one week from Thursday to Sunday and one evening on Thursday the following week which could work better.

A whole week in the long school holidays seems long for Chloe according to the mother, so a three-week block in summer might be something to postpone until both the children are in high school.

The mother would prefer week about throughout the long holidays and this would ·still allow the children to go to Queensland to visit the paternal grandparents.

### What recommendations you can make to assist the Court in determining the time that the children should live with o. r sp end time with each parent:

These children love sport and do not mind structure so they should have the benefit of learning to play sports and being part of a team. This enriches their lives and allows them to broaden their peer group network. I believe that both parents need to support their attendance at weekend sport by paying for it and taking them where possible or arranging for others to take them if not.

Children learn by modelling on their parent's behaviour. Both parents in this family are hardworking individuals who love their children. The father's obsessional attention to detail has marred his marriage and will alienate his children unless he can relax about issues. Demanding children finish everything on their plate is potentially cruel and an unnecessary focus and control of food is likely to emotionally scar a child. Encouraging moderation in filling their plate and offering the healthiest options is a far better way of assisting a child to learn the right choices.

Young children need their parents to do things with them even if it is boring to the parent and feels like a waste of time to them. Listening to and enacting the children' s choices sometimesis important in building their self-esteem.·

### Any other matter considered relevant:

Both the children seem well adjusted and their insecurity only evident before and after transitions to contact. That is, they have been co-sleeping with their mother. It is not a reason to suspend contact with their father.

The father, on the other hand, risks alienating his own children by making their time with him emotionally empty and all about his own needs to work and exercise and have· the children eat everything or complete games to his satisfaction and not to their own childish levels.
 

## Recommendations:

1. That the children live with their mother.

2. That the children have contact four nights a fortnight from Thursday to Sunday with school pick up on Thursday afternoon and school drop off on Monday morning and that they have dinner with the father on alternate Thursdays, the father to pick them up from school and drop them home at the mother' s.

3. That the Christmas holidays be week about every year until Chloe is in Year 7 and then they can have three weeks with one parent and then three weeks with the other.
