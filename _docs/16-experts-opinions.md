- This is not fair to say this, because I haven't had the same length of time with the kids,than that of what Alex has had with the kids. As I have only had the kids for 28.6% of the time, I haven't had the luxury of meeting the kids friends parents, organising sleepovers, or play dates. Should I have the kids longer, that is totally the plan, and has always been the thought in the back of my mind for me to meet the parents of the kids friends, also I would love it to be able to have a working relationship with the kids cousins parents (Alex's sister & brother in law) Andrew and Victoria, so the kids can continue their own relationship with their Sydney cousins - Henry and Chelsea. I don't hate Alex and that side fo the family, and am quite prepared to make this work.

    I have already got a list of the kids **primary friends** parents and their phone numbers in my phone:

    | My Kid | Their friend | Friend's parent |
    | ------ | ------ | ------ |
    | Charlie | Oscar  | San (Dad) |
    | Charlie | Theo & Noah  | Jackie (Mum), Brad (Dad) |
    | Chloe | Letha  | Hannah (Mum) |
    | Chloe | Layla  | Deb (Mum) |
    | Charlie | Nicholas  | Betty (Mum), Benny (Dad) |
    | Charlie | Eden | Rachael (Mum), Masa (Dad) |

As you can see, I am all over it. With only 28.6% of the time that I have the kids, it's challenging.

During school holidays, the kids already hang out with their friends in which I organise through this contact list above. 

However during non-school holiday time, the time I have with the kids is greatly reduced so its different obviously as we are time poor with only the one weekend and I generally spend the time and play with them instead. During non-school holiday weekends, I try and maximise my time with the kids as I only see the kids for the lesser time. 

Should I get more time with the kids, week on / week off, then even during non-school holidays I'd adopt the same as school holidays and there would totally be more friend time with the kids.
