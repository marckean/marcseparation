## My rebuttal

FIrstly, let's define what it really means if a kids says they're full and let's hear it from a kids mind, my son Charlie:

In February of 2019, my son was aged 8 and he ate 4 Sushi Rolls (not forced) on his own accord:

This is open to interpretation, it's not force feeding them, I'm not there with a stick and literally forcing them until they are crying, they are not in any emotional distress at all, completely the opposite. I know my kids and the last time they ate, and I also know for their sizes how much they can eat (it's not force feeding them at all) it's understanding how much they can eat and making sure they eat everything on their plate what it served. It's also an understanding on kids metabolisms, they are both growing kids and it's important they get good food with a balanced diet. You also need to look at what is on the plate, it's a mix of all the healthy food groups, portions of protein and veggies. 

If we compare this to me, same thing happened to my sister and I when we were young, both myself and my sister are not over weight, do not have a weight problem nor do we have any health issues as a result of food. Myself, I'm tall very tall (6 foot 6) and both my kids will be also very tall and will grow much more than other kids. 

It is true that other 'friends' of the kids who do get away with 'picking' at things, e.g. picking everything off a ham & pineapple pizza leaving just the cheese, these kids do and will have eating problems when they get older, as they are left to decide what food they do and don't eat, which means they are not getting the correct nutrition.  

The Jalapeno episode was once, where I wanted the kids to try Jalapenos, the second time I accidentally put Jalapenos on Chloe's sandwich, then took them off straight after I realised and it was the juice remains of the Jalapenos which was a little hot.
